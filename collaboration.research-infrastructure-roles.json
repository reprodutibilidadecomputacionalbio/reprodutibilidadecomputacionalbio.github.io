In the top left is a person in a construction crane carrying a series of ones and zeroes wearing a hard-hat looking down. They are labeled \"Research Software Engineer\". In the bottom left, we see an older male-presenting person with a cane scratching his head looking at a math formula sketched onto the side of a building. Next to them is two pink fluffy rams. One is trapped insight of a light bulb. I hope they manage to escape... This scene is labeled \"Research Application Managers\". In the top right is a female-presenting person in a pink shirt sketching ones and zeroes onto the side of a bridge who is labeled \"Data Steward\".
