First, in the centre of the image is a large maple leaf, where it's interior has been sectioned into four panels. Each panel has an individual contributing to a collaboration cafe. All individuals are facing each other, by looking diagonally towards the center of where all four panels join. The individuals are (in the top left) holding a physical copy of a document, (in the bottom left) holding a mug, (in the bottom right) holding their hand up and raising their index finger, gesturing to bring something up. The maple leaf also has a green banner below reading \"Collaboration Cafe\". Secondly, there is an oval element, connected, via a continuous line, to the top right portion of the maple leaf. In this oval element, 5 individuals are sitting on a leaf-shaped table, in discussion. Lastly, there is a second oval element, connected via a continuous line, to the top left portion of the maple leaf.
