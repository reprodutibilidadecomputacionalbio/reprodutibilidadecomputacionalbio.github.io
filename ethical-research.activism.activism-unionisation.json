Several Nobel Prize winners were members.\nThe union organised scientists and technicians in government and private sector research, and became a prominent propagandist for the expansion of publicly funded R&D as well as taking political positions regarding the ethical use of science, against the global threat of fascism, and of guiding scientific research towards peaceful ends.\nThe AScW went on to found the World Federation of Scientific Workers in 1946, an organisation which during the Cold War was accused of toeing the Soviet line, and being a communist front.","position":{"start":{"line":88,"column":1},"end":{"line":88,"column":1}},"key":"QVj9iIPvqq"}],"key":"MzkG4QRvVk"}],"key":"caWv5l6j91"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":94,"column":1},"end":{"line":94,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The AScW communicated with members via branch bulletins as well as a national paper: The Scientific Worker ","position":{"start":{"line":94,"column":1},"end":{"line":94,"column":1}},"key":"xdAhl3RIDf"},{"type":"link","url":"https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19915299#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.8157%2C-0.0826%2C2.6314%2C1.6529","position":{"start":{"line":94,"column":1},"end":{"line":94,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Click here to read a copy on the Wellcome Archive","position":{"start":{"line":94,"column":1},"end":{"line":94,"column":1}},"key":"wcmPlQdMmq"}],"urlSource":"https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19915299#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.8157%2C-0.0826%2C2.6314%2C1.6529","key":"MiNgZfY1em"}],"key":"v4GnSdHvQh"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":97,"column":1},"end":{"line":97,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I have never been part of a union before: where do I start?","position":{"start":{"line":97,"column":1},"end":{"line":97,"column":1}},"key":"MydMf2fAxl"}],"label":"er-activism-unionisation-start","identifier":"er-activism-unionisation-start","html_id":"er-activism-unionisation-start","key":"QpQmnCR3PY"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":99,"column":1},"end":{"line":103,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Start by finding out if there is a union already in your workplace.\nIf so, there will be a person you can talk to about joining: they might be known as the union rep or steward.\nJoining the union that already represents people in your workplace increases its ability to bargain on behalf of everyone and organise the workplace.\nSome workplaces may have several different unions that represent different types of staff.\nIn these cases, you should join the one you feel best matches the type of work you do.","position":{"start":{"line":99,"column":1},"end":{"line":99,"column":1}},"key":"cYJqxVWkPO"}],"key":"eMcEJlA6Tk"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":105,"column":1},"end":{"line":106,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If there is not a union in your workplace, look into the unions that already exist in your area or country.
