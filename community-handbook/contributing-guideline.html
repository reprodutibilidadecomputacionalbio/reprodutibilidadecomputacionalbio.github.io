Here are a few examples of such actions:</p><ul><li>use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language (learn more about inclusive writing on page 22 of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/ssds/oers/study-skills/studyskills.pdf" class="">University of Leicester Study Skills pdf</a>, also available as a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/ssds/oers/study-skills/studyskills_HTML.zip" class="">zipped html</a>).</li><li>aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds such as science, humanities and social sciences by not limiting the scope to only scientific domains.</li><li>make sure that the colour palettes are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors.

You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as <strong>bold</strong> (<code>**bold**</code>), or in <em>italics</em> (<code>_italics_</code>), or as a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="">link</a> (<code>[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)</code>) to another webpage.</p><p>Also when writing in Markdown, please <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/style.html#write-each-sentence-in-a-new-line-line-breaks" class="">start each new sentence on a new line</a>.

<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/" class="">This blog</a> explains how to write a good Git commit message and why it matters.
It is also perfectly fine to have a lot of commits - including ones that break code.
A good rule of thumb is to push up to GitHub when you <em>do</em> have passing tests then the continuous integration (CI) has a good chance of passing everything. 😸</p><p>If you feel tempted to “branch out” then please make a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository" class="">new branch</a> and a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues" class="">new issue</a> to go with it. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" class="">This blog</a> details the different Git branching models.</p><p>Please do not re-write history!
That is, please do not use the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase" class="">rebase</a> command to edit previous commit messages, combine multiple commits into one, or delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary.</p><p>Are you new to Git and GitHub or just want a detailed guide on getting started with version control?

This allows everyone to see what is currently being worked on.
It also provides you, the contributor, feedback in real-time from both the community and the continuous integration as you make commits (which will help prevent stuff from breaking).</p><p>When you are ready to submit a pull request, you will automatically see the <a href="https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Pull Request Template</a> contents in the pull request body.
It asks you to:</p><ul><li>Describe the problem you’re trying to fix in the pull request, reference any related issue and use fixes/close to automatically close them, if pertinent.</li><li>List of changes proposed in the pull request.</li><li>Describe what the reviewer should concentrate their feedback on.</li></ul><p>By filling out the “<em>Lorem ipsum</em>” sections of the pull request template with as much detail as possible, you will make it really easy for someone to review your contribution!</p><p>If you have opened the pull request early and know that its contents are not ready for review or to be merged, add “[WIP]” at the start of the pull request title, which stands for “Work in Progress”.
When you are happy with it and are happy for it to be merged into the main repository, change the “[WIP]” in the title of the pull request to “[Ready for review]”.</p><p>A member of <em>The Turing Way</em> team will then review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main repository.
A <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews" class="">review</a> will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you’ve done.
Keep an eye on your GitHub notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.</p><p>You can update your <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo" class="">fork</a> of <em>The Turing Way</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/" class="">repository</a> and the pull request will automatically update with those changes.
You don’t need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to a review.</p><p>You can also submit pull requests to other contributors’ branches!
Do you see an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pulls" class="">open pull request</a> that you find interesting and want to contribute to?
Simply make your edits on their files and open a pull request to their branch!</p><p>What happens if the continuous integration (CI) fails (for example, if the pull request notifies you that “Some checks were not successful”)?
The CI could fail for a number of reasons.
At the bottom of the pull request, where it says whether your build passed or failed, you can click “Details” next to the test, which takes you to a CI run log site.
If you have the write access to the repo, you can view the log or rerun the checks by clicking the “Restart build” button in the top right.
You can learn more about CI in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/ci.html" class="">Continuous Integration chapter</a>!</p><p>GitHub has a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow" class="">nice introduction</a> to the pull request workflow, but please <span data-state="closed"><a href="#get-in-touch" class="hover-link">get in touch</a></span> if you have any questions :balloon:.</p><h2 id="the-process-of-writing-chapters" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">The process of writing chapters</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#the-process-of-writing-chapters" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><ul><li>Fork the repository from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way" class=""><code>the-turing-way/the-turing-way</code></a> if you have not done so already.<ul><li>On your fork create a branch with the name as the chapter to be written and create a markdown file on it.</li></ul></li><li>If you are a contributor to the project repository, you can also create a branch on the main repository with the same name as the chapter to be written without creating a fork (or a local copy).</li><li>Copy the relevant part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/templates/chapter-template" class="">chapter template</a> into the markdown file, and commit.</li><li>Make a pull request to <em>The Turing Way</em> version of the chapter branch.

Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (<code>all-contributors/add-&lt;username&gt;</code>) before adding another one.

(Don’t feel bad, we have all done it! 🙈)
Simply close the pull request and delete the branch (<code>all-contributors/add-&lt;username&gt;</code>).
