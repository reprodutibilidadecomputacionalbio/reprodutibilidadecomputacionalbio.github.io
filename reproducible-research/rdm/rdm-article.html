is a publication that is focused on the description of a dataset.
It uses the traditional journal article structure, but focuses on the data-collection and methodological aspects and generally not on the interpretation or discussion of the results.</p><h2 id="rr-rdm-article-motivations" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Motivations For Sharing Data through a Data Article</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-rdm-article-motivations" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Data articles are in line with the <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair">FAIR principles</a>, especially since most publishers will encourage you to share the data through a data repository.
The benefit of a Data Article is that your output will be <a class="" href="/communication/peer-review">peer reviewed</a>, something which is generally not the case for datasets that are archived on <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing">data repositories</a>.
It also facilitates recognition for datasets through research assessment procedures that are more traditionally focused on publication output.
Publishing a data paper will therefore increase the visibility, credibility and usability of the data, as well as giving you credit as a data producer.</p><p>You can find out more in our <a class="" href="/communication/dif-articles/data">subchapter on publishing a data article</a> or you can read a blogpost on ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ekaroune.github.io/The-Open-Archaeobotanist/2021-01-30-what_a_data_paper_could_do_for_you/" class="">What a data paper could do for you</a>’.</p><h2 id="rr-rdm-article-options" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Options to publish a Data Article</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-rdm-article-options" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Below you can find some journals that publish data articles or papers.
