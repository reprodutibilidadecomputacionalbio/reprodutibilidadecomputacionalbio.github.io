It usually entails text, binary files and software.</p><p>Importantly, OSH projects should share both raw and derived source files.
For instance, 3D object designs should be shared as print-ready files (.stl), but also as modifiable 3D objects (the format of these files will depend on the software used).
It is necessary to provide the raw files to enable modification, even if they can often only be opened in proprietary software, and their use requires specific skills.
The derived versions are used to build the hardware, but often are not suited for modification.
Users with access to the tools that can read and manipulate these raw source files can update and improve the physical device.
If they wish, they can proceed to share such modifications.</p><p>Although OSH projects are diverse in their degree of “openness”, best practices in OSH guide us to identify a core, minimum documentation that needs to be in place so others can study, modify, distribute, make or sell our hardware.
We will go through these various components in the following sections.</p><h3 id="types-and-phases-of-open-source-hardware" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Types and phases of open source hardware</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#types-and-phases-of-open-source-hardware" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><figure id="open-hardware" class="fig-figure"><img id="MPhqDCGo2q" style="height:500px;margin:0 auto" src="/build/open-hardware-b06b1bfa3f61fd1971b7ef5b7e807164.jpg" alt="Illustration showing the life cycle of an open hardware project in research, using seeds and gardening tools as an analogy. The figure shows a circle with six stages surrounding the open hardware logo and gardening tools (a fork, shears and watering can), going clockwise starting on the top. Stage 1 NEED: it represents a researcher thinking about a seed that represent an idea that would solve its problem. Stage 2: Prototyping: Three different seeds are represented, the last one has flowers and roots, which are labeled. This represents the action to try out or &quot;prototyping&quot; different tools to address the need. Stage 3: Selection/Demo: Next to gardening tools, the third prototype is represented as a schematic on a board and a researcher is writing notes. It represents a stage where a prototype can be selected for further development. Stage 4: Documentation: Several boards present separately the roots, the flower and a fork, Six researchers are writing notes about the boards. This represent the inclusion of, these design choices and criteria in the project documentation, so others can follow and learn from the design process. Stage 5: Publishing: An actor is throwing seeds out of a window, another person is receiving the seeds with open arms; on the top we can see three square with labels on it: Reuse, Replicate, Reproduce. This represents the moment a researcher shares openly the designs and documentation of the new device, which can be reused, replicated or reproduce by others to better understand how data was produced. Stage 6: Cultivate ecosystem of open knowledge: A watering can pour water on five plants that are in the soil, two people can be seen on the other side looking at the plants.

For example, you may need to process lots of samples, or to measure a parameter you were not considering before, or to take measurements outside of the lab.
With the analyzing of your need, your OSH project starts.
It is advisable to scope the project at this point, maybe looking for similar project one can join, instead of starting a new one.
It may indeed be useful to draw a roadmap, look and find future users, contributors and manufacturers (who may have complementary skills to yours), and decide for a license.
It is reasonable to invest quite a lot of time in looking for similar projects.
OSH are often difficult to find and comprehend, but finding projects may save you a lot of time and hassle.
Indeed, you may learn a lot about your needs, refine your ideas, and may even find collaborators while browsing existing OSH projects.</p><p>You may then test some ideas to address your particular need, which is a process called <strong>prototyping</strong>.
After many iterations and testing, you will be able to select a prototype for further development.
The design that solves your need but is not yet complete nor ready to be replicated (usually because some parts are not well documented or requires a lot of manual adjustments) is called a <strong>demonstrator</strong>.
When the design and documentation are polished and are ready to be used by hardware producers, the hardware is usually labeled as a <strong>market-ready product</strong>.</p><p>While many people start generating <strong>documentation</strong> and share their design online at the demonstrator stage, open science enthusiasts advise being open from the beginning of the description of needs phase.</p><p>There are different degrees for how open an OSH project can be <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2018.08.306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">Bonvoisin &amp; Mies, 2018</a></cite></span>, but every step in this direction is welcome and an opportunity to contribute to better research and open new career paths.
Designs that are well-documented and offer a solution to a concrete problem can be easily <strong>reused</strong> by others.
They may <strong>replicate</strong> your design exactly to test it, or <strong>reproduce</strong> it to adapt it to their particular need.
It is worth thinking about your future self as one of the project collaborators when balancing the resources used in opening and documenting an OSH project, and the resources used to develop the hardware further.</p><p>In order to make your project more open, one can work on several aspects of open source, which are outlined in the following sections.</p><h2 id="why-should-you-use-or-develop-open-source-hardware" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Why should you use or develop open source hardware?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#why-should-you-use-or-develop-open-source-hardware" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><figure id="why-open-hardware" class="fig-figure"><img id="DHYTa4n7Zm" style="height:500px;margin:0 auto" src="/build/why-open-hardware-7fdd8964f6a7f4326763ff7c1dc6e07d.jpg" alt="Illustration showing the benefits of using Open Science Hardware for Research and for researchers.

Control is another benefit for the individual researcher, as new features can be included, others removed and set ups completely customized beyond what is established by a third party vendor.

Particularly in research, OSH provides very concrete advantages:</p><ul><li><p>Flexibility and Speed: You can quickly customize and combine open designs to test new research questions in an accessible way, instead of depending on vendors, their timelines and bureaucracy.</p></li><li><p>Simplicity: As OSH has a lower price tag than conventional equipment, it is much easier to obtain while bypassing the bureaucracy of contracting vendors.</p></li><li><p>Control: If a supplier goes out of business, users and/or third party companies have the information to keep systems running.</p></li><li><p>Visibility: Researchers and engineers developing OSH make their work more visible to more people.

Local adaptation and production of OSH helps reducing the impact of import restrictions and bureaucracies that obstaculise science.

This is usually done via specific online platforms (see <span data-state="closed"><a href="#rr-open-hardware-platforms" class="hover-link">Platforms</a></span>.
The type and amount of shared content depends on the complexity of the OSH, and on the importance of the community aspects of the project.</p><p>In the following sections, you can find descriptions of the common types of content that you should consider sharing, such as project documentation, technical documentation, and community interactions.
You are not required to post or document them all, but the more you share, the more the community benefits, and the more it can give back.</p><p>There is a lot of crossover with files to include in open source software projects
(see <span data-state="closed"><a class="hover-link" href="/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata#rr-rdm-metadata-documentation">Documentation</a></span>), and the community aspects that are common to any open source project are described elsewhere  (see <a class="" href="/project-design/pd-overview/pd-overview-repro">Collaborative project documentation</a>)</p><h3 id="project-documentation" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Project documentation</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#project-documentation" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Your OSH project should at a minimum provide a license <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-hardware">Open Hardware Licenses</a> together with a README file with all the basic, general information a newcomer needs to get oriented.
Include a general description of the hardware’s identity and purpose, written as much as possible for a general audience.
That is, explain what the project is and what it is for, before you get into the technical details.</p><p>On top of what is mentioned in detail in the open source project documentation page (<a class="" href="/project-design/pd-overview/pd-overview-repro">Collaborative project documentation</a>) for project plan, people involved, and contribution process,
you should specifically <strong>think about your audience</strong> when writing OSH documentation.
Indeed,
your project might be reused by people with different skills, roles, objectives, and socio-economic and cultural environments.
Because of this it can be useful to create a <strong>list of skills</strong> that are required to build or use the hardware.
Someone trying to build it from scratch, for example, will require specific set of prior knowledge, skills, and tools.
A different set is needed to perform maintenance tasks.
An end user operating the assembled project might require an entirely distinct skillset (and documentation).</p><p><strong>Take particular care about safety instructions. OSH makers are not always formally trained engineers and may not be able to easily differentiate between dangerous and safe manipulations.</strong></p><p>Your project documentation may also include a functional overview of the project’s parts or modules, as well as a short description of the software needed to use the hardware.
Also give an overview of the state of the hardware, software and documentation (current state, ongoing development, and/or any future plans for the project), and other information you think may be useful for newcomers.</p><h3 id="rr-open-hardware-techdoc" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Technical documents</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-open-hardware-techdoc" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Technical documents provide the source needed to study and replicate a hardware design.
In contrast to project documentation and community building, technical documents for OSH are quite specific, but can be considered analogous to what source code is for software.
Depending on the project, technical documents may include technical drawings, images describing electronic schematics, computer-aided design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">CAD</a>) files, or assembly instructions to replicate the design.
A thoroughly documented project will have all types of documents.
It may also include code (firmware and software) necessary to run the hardware.
The source files (like CAD files) are best accompanied by textual and multi-medial documentation, such as guides for manufacturing, assembly, maintenance, and development.</p><p>We provide here a quite exhaustive list of documentation elements.
Your project may not need all of them, but it is worth considering having at least minimal information for most of these elements:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>context description</strong> which may reflect project maturity, complexity, the intentions of authors on how it should be used, and technical specifications.
It may include standards compliance (the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://gitlab.com/OSEGermany/OHS-3105" class="">DIN-SPEC</a> standard for instance) and an estimation of the overall budget required and build time.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Bill of Materials</strong> (BOM): A list or spreadsheet describing part numbers, putative suppliers, costs, and a short description.
Make it easy to tell which item in the bill of materials corresponds to which component in your design files: use matching reference designators in both places, provide a diagram indicating which part goes where, or otherwise explain the correspondence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assembly instructions</strong>. To help others make and modify your hardware design, you should provide instructions for going from your design files to the working physical hardware.
It is good to publish annotated photographs (or video) from multiple viewpoints and at various stages of assembly.
If you do not have photos, posting annotated 3D renderings of your design is a good alternative.
Either way, it is good to provide captions or text that explain what is shown in each image and why it is useful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manufacturing instructions</strong>: The manufacturing process of parts that have been made for this project should be documented as well.
This is specially important if they are available for purchase from only a handful of small/medium businesses.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>list of required tools</strong> and associated settings, for both the software used for development and the machine tools for replication.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design files</strong> with parts metadata, typically including the manufacturing process, the materials with dimensions, mass, and units.
A functional overview of the project’s parts/modules can also be included.
Ideally, your OSH project would be designed using a free and open source software application, to maximize the ability of others to view and edit it.
It is essential to share these original design files, in both original and accessible ready-to-view formats.
The type of parts can also be mentioned with unambiguous reference, between, custom parts (developed as a result of this or another project), off-the-shelf parts (like screws) or (maybe proprietary) complex modules (for example, a single board computer).</p></li><li><p><strong>Software and firmware</strong>: You should share any code or firmware required to operate your hardware.
This will allow others to use it with their hardware or modify it along with their modifications to your hardware.
Document the process required to build your software, including links to any dependencies (for example, third-party libraries or tools).
In addition, it is helpful to provide an overview of the state of the software (for example, “stable” or “beta” or “barely-working hack”).</p></li><li><p><strong>Instructions for operation and maintenance</strong>: Describe how hardware users should operate the hardware (for example how to calibrate and test it).
Indicate any maintenance that should be done to secure a good functionality of the hardware.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repair and disposal</strong>: Indicate where or how the hardware can be repaired, and indicate how to dispose or recycle the hardware, if it is beyond repair.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Note that producing documentation-quality pictures consistently requires adequate tools and setup.</p></blockquote><h3 id="community-documentation" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Community documentation</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#community-documentation" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>While open hardware communities are sometimes different than open software communities, the documentation useful to grow hardware communities are similar to those for a open source project, see the  <a class="" href="/project-design/pd-overview/pd-overview-repro">Collaborative project documentation</a> chapter.

We should therefore consider that developing good quality hardware and making it open source already entails an important aspect of community building.</p><p>In the following section, we share some considerations about community building for OSH project.</p><h4 id="considerations-for-osh-community-building" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Considerations for OSH community building</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#considerations-for-osh-community-building" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h4><p>While scoping your project, it is well advised to think about the different people who may engage with your OSH (see <span data-state="closed"><a class="hover-link" href="/collaboration/stakeholder-engagement#cl-stakeholder-mapping">Stakeholder mapping</a></span>).
Different OSH projects have included different partners at varying stages of their development.
On top of user and contributor roles that OSH have in common with open source software, local or global hardware manufacturers may become important partners of your project.
You may also think early about the people who will eventually have to maintain and repair the hardware.
To make it easier for them, it also helps to make your hardware designs modular (splitting your hardware in modules which may have alternative designs).
Another specificity of hardware may be the importance of the creation of replication tutorials, workshops, seminars, or training materials, which can impact the adoption of hardware designs.
This is particularly relevant if the OSH is meant to be produced in Do-It-Yourself environments or as a teaching opportunity.</p><aside class="myst-admonition myst-admonition-note my-5 shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-gray-50/10 dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden myst-admonition-default rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500"><div class="myst-admonition-header m-0 font-medium py-1 flex min-w-0 text-lg text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-900"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="2rem" height="2rem" class="myst-admonition-header-icon inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none text-blue-600"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m11.25 11.25.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Zm-9-3.75h.008v.008H12V8.25Z"></path></svg><div class="myst-admonition-header-text text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words">Note</div></div><div class="myst-admonition-body px-4 py-1"><p>Engineering culture can still be a closed one, not very welcoming to newcomers from different backgrounds.</p><p>It is therefore particularly important to Valuing Diversity and Differences in OSH <a class="" href="/collaboration/new-community/new-community-differences">Valuing Diversity and Differences</a></p></div></aside><p>It is important to decide whether, when and where you want to engage with, or build a community.

Some hardware project have large files, and one may need to look for platforms and workflows allowing to work with big files (see <span data-state="closed"><a class="hover-link" href="/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-data#rr-vcs-data">Version Control for Data</a></span>).</p><h3 id="making-hardware-discoverable" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Making hardware discoverable</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#making-hardware-discoverable" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>There is (yet) no straightforward way to let others to know about your project online.
Here we list some actions you may take in order to
make your project more visible, reach more people, and improve the chances of reproducibility:</p><ol start="1"><li>Use a commonly used platform; often they have a discovery page and people expect your project to be on such platforms.</li><li>Use metadata to describe your project, apart from just your technical data it is also important to share the metadata of your project, for example a short disciption, a statement of the license, the context of your project.
Adding a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.internetofproduction.org/openknowhow" class="">Open-Know-How manifest</a> yaml file may help.</li><li>Refer to the guide for communication <a class="" href="/communication/comms-overview">Overview of the Guide for Communication</a> and make a presskit or media content for others to easily share your project on other blogs or websites.</li></ol><p>In academia, researchers may also <strong>publish</strong> their hardware (usually at the demonstrator stage), as peer-reviewed articles and <strong>archive</strong> a version to generate a DOI.</p><h3 id="making-hardware-citable" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Making hardware citable</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#making-hardware-citable" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>In contrast to data and software, there is no recommendation for hardware citation yet.
However, we think it is good practice to treat hardware citation similarly to other research outputs <a class="" href="/communication/citable">Making Research Objects Citable</a>.
Making open hardware citable is indeed useful for academic and research output.
The use of archives that can assign persistent identifiers (DOI) can help to guarantee specific versions/releases of the hardware project available over the long term.
Though within the open hardware community this is not the practice, it would be beneficial to adopt going forward.
For research to be reproducible, long term archiving through a platform that is dedicated to it would be necessary.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://zenodo.org/" class="">Zenodo</a> is a good example of the type of archive that can issue a persistent identifier like a DOI.
Zenodo also has an integration with Github such that projects that are shared and developed there can be archived with ease and a DOI obtained for a specific version/release.</p><h3 id="open-source-hardware-licencing" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Open source hardware licencing</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#open-source-hardware-licencing" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>A crucial step to making OSH open is by adding an open license.
Without an open license, others cannot legally use, copy, distribute, or modify that project.
The situation of hardware licensing is a bit more complex than for research outputs like software, as there are some cases where patent law and not copyright law will apply.
Also note that you may use different licenses for different part of the project.</p><p>Please refer to <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/licensing">Licensing</a> and <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-hardware">Open Hardware Licenses</a>.</p><p>Common OSH license are:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/" class="">TAPR</a></li><li>Similar to GNU GPL 3.0, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://solderpad.org/" class="">SOLDERPAD</a></li><li>Similar to Apache License 2.0, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2" class="">CERN-OHL 2</a> which comes as:<ul><li>CERN-OHL-S (Strongly reciprocal)</li><li>CERN-OHL-W (Weakly reciprocal)</li><li>CERN-OHL-P (Permissive).</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="references-glossary" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">References/glossary</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#references-glossary" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Standardisation of Practices in Open Source Hardware by <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2018.08.306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">Bonvoisin &amp; Mies, 2018</a></cite></span></p><p>This Chapter of the book was created reusing the following documents:</p><ul><li>Open Hardware Academy: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.openhardware.academy/03_Lessons.html" class="">https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.openhardware<wbr/>.academy<wbr/>/03<wbr/>_Lessons<wbr/>.html</a></li><li>Open Hardware Makers: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://curriculum.openhardware.space/" class="">https://<wbr/>curriculum<wbr/>.openhardware<wbr/>.space/</a></li><li>UKRN primer on open science hardware</li></ul><div></div><section id="references" class="article-grid subgrid-gap col-screen"><div><header class="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-900 dark:text-white group">References<a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit ml-2 select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#references" title="Link to References" aria-label="Link to References">¶</a></header></div><div class="pl-3 mb-8 text-xs text-stone-500 dark:text-stone-300"><ol><li class="break-words" id="cite-https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807">The Turing Way Community, & Scriberia.

The figure shows a circle with six stages surrounding the open hardware logo and gardening tools (a fork, shears and watering can), going clockwise starting on the top. Stage 1 NEED: it represents a researcher thinking about a seed that represent an idea that would solve its problem. Stage 2: Prototyping: Three different seeds are represented, the last one has flowers and roots, which are labeled. This represents the action to try out or \"prototyping\" different tools to address the need. Stage 3: Selection/Demo: Next to gardening tools, the third prototype is represented as a schematic on a board and a researcher is writing notes. It represents a stage where a prototype can be selected for further development. Stage 4: Documentation: Several boards present separately the roots, the flower and a fork, Six researchers are writing notes about the boards. This represent the inclusion of, these design choices and criteria in the project documentation, so others can follow and learn from the design process. Stage 5: Publishing: An actor is throwing seeds out of a window, another person is receiving the seeds with open arms; on the top we can see three square with labels on it: Reuse, Replicate, Reproduce. This represents the moment a researcher shares openly the designs and documentation of the new device, which can be reused, replicated or reproduce by others to better understand how data was produced. Stage 6: Cultivate ecosystem of open knowledge: A watering can pour water on five plants that are in the soil, two people can be seen on the other side looking at the plants. This represents the hardware commons, the new piece of knowledge can become a building block for others to explore new research questions or scenarios, especially when work is invested in growing a community.","height":"500px","urlSource":"../../../figures/open-hardware.jpg","key":"MPhqDCGo2q"},{"type":"caption","children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":56,"column":1},"end":{"line":56,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"captionNumber","kind":"figure","label":"open-hardware","identifier":"open-hardware","html_id":"open-hardware","enumerator":"1","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Figure ","key":"kDQ6iLnUek"},{"type":"text","value":"1","key":"CCm0Efdx61"},{"type":"text","value":":","key":"PMZjYVxqQX"}],"template":"Figure %s:","key":"mR4h3ZSlXK"},{"type":"emphasis","position":{"start":{"line":56,"column":1},"end":{"line":56,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Turing Way","position":{"start":{"line":56,"column":1},"end":{"line":56,"column":1}},"key":"wU44yKEYWh"}],"key":"Ta7p7NtcgK"},{"type":"text","value":" project illustration by Scriberia.

On top, the figure shows a cycle divided in two parts, on the bottom, there is a person with short hair surrounded by a microscope, a computer and electronic elements. In its hand, it has a pile of paper lebelled “how to”, which represents the hardware documentation. The lower half circle is labelled “Science” and is surrounded with several half full bechers. Inside the half circle one can read four bullet points: Quality, Reproducibility, Inclusiveness, and Sustainability. The upper half circle is labelled “YOU”, it is surrounded by one person with goggles and earrings. Inside the half circle one can read four bullet points: Flexibility and speed, Price, Control, and Visibility., It represents the benefits of the Open Hardware practice for the individual researcher. These include greater flexibility and speed, as experimental set ups can easily be modified without depending on vendors. Another benefit is price, as open science hardware is today less expensive than available proprietary options. Control is another benefit for the individual researcher, as new features can be included, others removed and set ups completely customized beyond what is established by a third party vendor.
