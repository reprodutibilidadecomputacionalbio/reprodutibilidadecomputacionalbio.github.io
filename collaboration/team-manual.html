Who can propose the changes (ideally every member) and what is the process?
Do you keep multiple versions of the lab manual?

How does the team manage and share code, data, materials?
How is documentation done?</li><li>Research process:
how is research conducted at the lab?
How is the data analysed?
How is the code written, version controlled?
See for example the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://theodi.org/article/check-out-our-rd-open-research-tools/" class="">Research toolkit by the Open Data Institute</a>.

Consider setting up a code of conduct or policy on scientific integrity (and align with the <span data-state="closed"><a href="#cl-team-manual-policies" class="hover-link">institutional/national policies</a></span> on this).
What should people do when they encounter harassment/discrimination? What is the lab culture?</li><li>Credit: How to provide appropriate credit to the right people?
How to ensure that each contribution is recognised and rewarded?
This includes (lab) maintenance work, discussions, and ideas.</li><li>Metrics: When is a lab member successful?
How do you discuss and measure this progress so that the lab member can more easily succeed?
How are successes celebrated?
How are reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science practices included in this assessment?
How is maintenance work evaluated and celebrated?</li><li>Culture:
How are mistakes handled (see <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918801915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">Rouder <em>et al.</em>, 2019</a></cite></span>)?

what are the expectations around public outreach?
What is the social media policy for personal accounts?
How are all the materials made accessible (image descriptions - see <span data-state="closed"><a class="hover-link" href="/community-handbook/style/style-figures#ch-style-figures-alttext">Alternative text</a></span>, translations)?

They are in a better position to do so and have power over decision making.
This does not mean only senior members can be involved: the whole group should be able to provide input and it is important to hold discussions over points where there is no agreement in the group.</p><p>If you want to convince your supervisor that having a Team Manual is important:</p><ul><li>Check if a comparable lab is using a Lab Manual and show them this.
You can also use the list provided (see below <span data-state="closed"><a href="#cl-team-manual-examples" class="hover-link">Examples of Team Manuals</a></span>) as an example.</li><li>Team up with group members so that you’re not the only person that wants to implement it.</li><li>Start out with a simplified template or share a draft so that the supervisor can easily start.</li></ul><p>There needs to be a balance between an extensive and detailed manual and an operable manual that can be implemented.
Consider the points listed in this overview as ideas to mix and match from in no particular order, and use and adapt those that make most sense in your particular setting.</p><p>You can gather input on the Team Manual from group members via discussion sessions, or surveys.

If someone is not following the Lab Manual it needs to be discussed why this is the case.
It could be that the Lab Manual needs to be updated, or a discussion needs to take place to re-align the values of the group members, or perhaps this lab member is not a right fit for the group.</p><p>If someone breaks the agreements it needs to be clear what the consequences are.
The Team/Lab needs to be held accountable, as otherwise there is no point of having a Lab Manual.
