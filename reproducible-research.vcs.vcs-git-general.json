is not magic and it is good to know about its limitations.\nEspecially, Git works best with small text files.\nGit starts to be impracticable when too many files are present, or when the repository becomes too big (1 TB is about the limit).\nAs a Git repository stores every version of every file that is added to it, large files that undergo regular modifications can inflate the size of a·project significantly.\nIn research projects, datasets often contains thousands of files and/or contain (very) large files.\nWhile one can use Git for non-software application, one needs to plan to use specific workflows and/or additional tools to be able to use Git tools.\nIt is particularly problematic because everything will work fine in the beginning and it is very difficult to solve issues when the project is ongoing.\nIt is therefore important to plan ahead, and try to avoid big repositories.\nFor instance, one can split the files into different repositories and save binary files outside of Git.\nThere are tools allowing that while keeping git at the core of the version control (git-annex and submodules are possible technologies, see section
