You can read more about copyright and licensing in <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/licensing">the chapter on licensing</a>.
The ‘CC0’ is a public domain dedication waiving the copyright and anyone to use the work as they see fit.
There are a number of variants on the creative license which use the copyright on the work to stipulate terms on which it can be re-used.
The variants add or modify terms of the license, such as requiring attribution (BY), prohibiting commercial re-use (NC), prohibiting derivative works (ND), and requiring that any derivative works be shared under equivalent terms (SA).

Whilst these licenses sought to be considered <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-open-source-software" class="hover-link">open source</a></span>, their terms place restrictions on the uses to which the software can be put so that anyone using the software in a way the licenses consider unethical would potentially expose themselves to liability.

It grants permissions and states restrictions.
Broadly speaking, an open license is one that grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.

A project in which a significant amount of collaboration between the core or leadership team and the wider community takes place in the form of online interactions.
Community interactions should maintain transparency and openness of the project to facilitate the growth of your community.</dd><dt id="term-open-scholarship"><strong>Open scholarship</strong></dt><dd>This is a concept that extends open research further.
It relates to making other aspects of scientific research open to the public such as open educational resources, having inclusive practice and citizen science.</dd><dt id="term-open-source"><strong>Open source</strong></dt><dd><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240618150233/https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" class="">opensource.com</a> describes open source as:
“Something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible”.
The concept of ‘open source’ is now often extended beyond the context of its original coinage, <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-open-source-software" class="hover-link">software</a></span>,
to other forms of cultural or creative output, such as <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-open-source-hardware" class="hover-link">hardware</a></span> and <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-open-educational-resources" class="hover-link">educational resources</a></span>.
Referring to something as ‘open source’ generally means that it is available under an <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-open-license" class="hover-link">open license</a></span>.
The term can also extend to an <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-open-project" class="hover-link">open project</a></span> philosophy of collaboration beyond the mere availability and open licensing of the project’s source materials.
The term tends to, but need not, be applied in contexts where there is some ‘source’ material that is processed or synthesised into an output.
For example an image created with a simple bitmap editor might be referred to as ‘open source’ despite lacking something that can be considered a ‘source’.
In such cases the notion of a ‘<span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-creative-commons" class="hover-link">creative commons</a></span>’ or ‘<span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-free-cultural-works" class="hover-link">free cultural work</a></span>’ may better apply as these do not as obviously emphasise the availability source materials but rather end products,
though they may include source materials.
There are also a number adjacent concepts which most often question the conventional open source prohibtion on restricting the uses to which open source things can be put, examples include: ‘<span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-ethical-source-software" class="hover-link">ethical source</a></span>’ and ‘<span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-fair-code" class="hover-link">Fair Code</a></span>’.</dd><dt id="term-open-source-hardware"><strong>Open source hardware</strong></dt><dd>Hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.</dd><dt id="term-open-source-software"><strong>Open source software</strong></dt><dd>Broadly, users of the software must able to inspect, modify and redistribute the source code of the software as they see fit, and not restrict the uses to which the code can be put or by whom it can be used.
The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://opensource.org/" class="">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a> offers a widely used definition of Open Source Software: The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240619054907/https://opensource.org/osd" class="">Open Source Definition (OSD)</a> which is comprised of 10 criteria with which the terms of distribution of software must comply to meet their definition.
The OSI maintains a list of licenses which have gone through their review process and been approved.
Open source software should not be confused with <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-source-available" class="hover-link">source available</a></span> software it is not sufficient for the source code to be made available for a project to be considered open source.
Almost all open source software is also <span data-state="closed"><a href="#term-free-or-libre-software" class="hover-link">Free / Libre Software</a></span>.
