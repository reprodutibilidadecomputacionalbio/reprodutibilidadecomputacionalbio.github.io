hackathons.</em></p><p>Event planning and organisation involves many roles, tasks and responsibilities, which can be challenging, especially for online/hybrid conferences or other collaborative events that have a large target audience.</p><p>This document lists the various tasks for organising such events, which will be useful for people who do not have any former experience or professional support available to them.
In this subchapter, we discuss different aspects of conference organisation, which are listed in chronological order and divided into sets of tasks and responsibilities “before”, “during” and “after” the meeting.
Though created for longer events, these detailed task lists can be used for planning smaller events that have fewer logistical requirements.</p><p>Though we assume ‘virtual first’ approach for inclusive events, these recommendations have been drawn from in-person conference planning, and hence can be used for remote or in-person meetings with changes to adapt to a physical location.</p><h2 id="cl-organising-conferences-before" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Before the event</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#cl-organising-conferences-before" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>The different subsections are marked as “Earlier-phase”, “Mid-phase”, and “Later-phase”, based on their importance at the different phases of organisation.
