missingness will have a limited effect and bias on any results. Frequently, this is not possible. Thus, this sub-chapter provides an overview of some missing data handling methods. Additionally, discussing these methods can quickly get very technical; we will do our best to avoid using jargon and leave the technical explanations to the great, already existing, resources out there, linked in <a class="" href="/project-design/missing-data/missing-data-checklist-resources">Checklist and Resources</a>.</p><h2 id="pd-missing-data-methods-deletion" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Deletion</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#pd-missing-data-methods-deletion" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>The simplest way of handling missing data would be to remove any rows or data entries that have missing values in any variables of interest.

These methods are easy to implement and suitable when there are a small number of missing values in a large dataset.</p><p>In contrast, multiple imputation methods can generate several values for each missing value. This means that multiple imputation methods can also have an average value and variance assigned to each imputed value, thereby giving the option to test the stability of downstream analyses. One popular multiple imputation method is Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), which is explained <span data-state="closed"><a href="#pd-missing-data-methods-mice" class="hover-link">below</a></span>.</p><p>The more complicated imputation methods, such as those under the model-based, machine learning and optimization algorithm imputation headings tend to perform better when there are many missing values and can handle many types of missing data. These are harder to implement and usually require very large sample sizes to produce consistent results.</p><aside class="myst-admonition myst-admonition-note my-5 shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-gray-50/10 dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden myst-admonition-default rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500"><div class="myst-admonition-header m-0 font-medium py-1 flex min-w-0 text-lg text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-900"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="2rem" height="2rem" class="myst-admonition-header-icon inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none text-blue-600"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m11.25 11.25.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Zm-9-3.75h.008v.008H12V8.25Z"></path></svg><div class="myst-admonition-header-text text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words">Note</div></div><div class="myst-admonition-body px-4 py-1"><p>Some model-based methods can also be used to directly estimate model parameters for further downstream analyses (rather than directly calculating values to impute).</p></div></aside><p>Great care should be taken with imputation methods, as they may introduce or further amplify existing bias.

It uses the most complete data to inform the values of increasingly less complete entries. This is done iteratively in cycles, such that at the end of each cycle there is one set of imputed values <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v045.i03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">Buuren &amp; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011</a></cite></span>. A slightly more detailed explanation follows below.</p><p>The first step of a cycle involves filling in the missing values of all variables, using a simple method. Then, the variable with the least number of missing values are set back to missing. The observed values of that variable are regressed on variables in the rest of the dataset. Imputed values are then estimated using this regression model, and the missing values are replaced <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">Azur <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a></cite></span>. A different type of regression can be used for each variable, such that each variable is handled separately and can be assigned a unique distribution. This imputation also includes some randomness to capture the uncertainty of the imputed  <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><span class="hover-link">Wulff &amp; Jeppesen, 2017</span></cite></span>. Next, the variable with the 2nd least number of missing values are set back to missing and imputed as described previously, and so on. This is done iteratively, even after all missing values have been imputed. At the end of a set number of iterations over all variables (for example, 50 iterations), the cycle is complete and each missing value now has an unbiased estimated imputed value.</p><p>Often, MICE is done repeatedly, such that an average value and variance are obtained per imputed value. Therefore, 5 cycles may be completed, so that there are 5 imputed values per missing data point. Simulations can also be used to estimate the performance of MICE in a given dataset, and determine whether values are imputed within a certain tolerance. Another method of evaluating the imputation is by comparing the distributions of the original and the imputed data. If the distributions are quite similar, then the imputed values match.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example Imputation</strong>:

However, this is not the ideal dataset to be using MICE. In fact, MICE is suited best for MAR data and as we know our example dataset has all 3 types of data missingness.</p><p>In a more realistic dataset, the function parameters can be adjusted to improve the estimated values. For instance, the method of imputation can be changed to a Bayesian linear regression of multilevel model if this would be more appropriate for your data. It may also be more appropriate to create more imputed datasets, if there is a high level of missingness in the data <span class="cite-group parenthetical"><cite class="" data-state="closed"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.4067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover-link">White <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a></cite></span>.

The training step of the imputer can also be done separately to fitting (by using the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://imp.fit" class="">imp.fit</a> function first, and then imp.transform). This means that the training dataset can also be different to what is then provided to be imputed.</p><p>In the example above, we are showing the results from one MICE cycle. In order to obtain several cycle results (or multiple imputed values), then you need to manually apply it several times with different random seeds when sample_posterior=True.
