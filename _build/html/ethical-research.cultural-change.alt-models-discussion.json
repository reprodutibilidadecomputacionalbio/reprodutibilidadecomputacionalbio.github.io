our discussion began with many participants flagging that culture is part of an overarching series of systems within society, that are all interconnected and influence each other.\nCultural change in academia, like that sought by open research advocates, therefore needs to be understood through the lens of system change.\nFor example, many advocates want the academic credit and recognition system to move away from number of papers published as a metric for success.\nThis would mean changing the way that promotions are awarded, research institutions evaluated, and academic knowledge shared.\nPublishing companies, who make large profits from publishing academic research, are likely to fight against the change if they think it will harm their profits.\nIt is always possible to change cultures, big and small, but it will be easier when we take into account the wider factors also in play.\nWhen we seek to change the was research is produced we need to identify and consider

the portrayal by Nosek et al, of culture change as a pyramid with infrastructure at the bottom has drawn criticisms.\nCertainly participants in the culture change discussion expressed confusion, disconnect, and disappointment at the apparent disempowerment of communities inferred from their position in the diagram, and the exclusion of key factors in driving change, such as consultation with communities, feedback loops, and the impact this approach might have on researchers.\nThe explicit hierarchy can also be interpreted as assigning relative importance to each of the stages, when often their relative importance fluctuates depending on the norms, practices, existing infrastructure, and the influence that each of these factors exerts on the other.\nAlthough the blog post in which the model is introduced offers more context about why specifically, we now frequently see the diagram taken out of context and used to justify techno-solutionism.\nAdvocates for change therefore need to think critically about designing visual representations and how they may be misinterpreted or used out of context.\nThere is a balance between using simple structures and clear diagrams, and communicating complex concepts effectively.","position":{"start":{"line":33,"column":1},"end":{"line":33,"column":1}},"key":"UkEudmTYju"}],"key":"jrGnJi8xUZ"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":41,"column":1},"end":{"line":41,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Factors
