The first section in the image is the researcher looking at 10 data hazard labels under the heading 'Learn'. An arrow leads to the next step, where under the heading 'Apply' the group of people are looking at a research paper with the researcher and talking to one another, one person is raising a hand to ask a question. An arrow then leads to 'Display' where the researcher is pointing to their paper infront of an audience, with the hazard labels on each side. Learn, Apply and Display are all connected to the bigger title of Reflect, surrounded by a thought bubble.
