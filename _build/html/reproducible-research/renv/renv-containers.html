dependency stack can be huge.
Take a simple pipeline to build a pdf report for an analysis scripted in R using <code>Rmarkdown</code>, for example.
To make this reproducible, not only do (i) the respective R packages need to be installed and (ii) the R version needs to be the same, but also (iii) the versions of <code>pandoc</code> and <code>LaTeX</code> need to be the same as during runtime.</p><p>Instead of trying to resolve these dependencies via a package manager (such as conda) -  which also depends on all required software being available in a single package manager - it might be easier to create a snapshot of the entire computing environment including all dependencies.
These computing environments are then self-contained, hence the name ‘containers’.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction" class="">This RedHat blog

Anyone can then open up a container and work within it, viewing and interacting with the project as if the machine they are accessing it from is identical to the machine specified in the container - regardless of what their computational environment <em>actually</em> is.
They are designed to make it easier to
transfer projects between very different environments.</p><p>In a way, containers behave like a virtual machine. To the outside world, they look like their own complete system.
However, unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system plus all the software and tools typically packaged with one, containers only contain the individual components they need in order to operate the project they contain.
This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</p><p>Containers are a particularly useful way for reproducing research which relies on software to be configured in a certain way, or which makes use of libraries that vary between (or do not exist on) different systems.
In summary, containers are a more robust way of sharing reproducible research than package management systems or Binder because they reproduce the entire system used for the research, not just the packages explicitly used by it.
Their major downside is that due to their greater depth, they are conceptually more difficult to grasp and produce than many other methods of replicating computational environments.</p><p>Ben Corrie give a reasonably accessible overview of core concepts in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnJ7qX9fkcU" class="">‘What is a container?’</a>.</p><h2 id="rr-renv-containers-images" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">What are Images?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-images" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Images are the files used to generate containers.
Humans do not make images; they write recipes to generate images.
Containers are then identical copies instantiated from images.</p><p>Think of it like this:</p><ul><li>A recipe file a human writes contains all the steps to generate a working version of the project and its computational environment, but no actual materials.
Think of this as a blueprint.</li><li>Building an image takes that recipe and using it, assembles all the packages, software libraries, and configurations needed to make the full-fledged project and environment, and bundles them up in a condensed lump.

Think of this as assembling the flat-pack furniture.</li></ul><p>So if a researcher wants to allow others to reproduce their work, they would need to write a recipe file, and use it to build an image of their project.
They can then share this image file with anyone who wants to replicate their work.
That person can then use the image to generate a container containing a working version of the project.</p><h2 id="rr-renv-containers-docker" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Docker</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-docker" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><h3 id="rr-renv-containers-whatdocker" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">What is Docker?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-whatdocker" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>There are many tools available for creating and working with containers.
We will focus on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.docker.com/" class="">Docker</a>, which is widely used, but be aware that others such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://apptainer.org/" class="">Apptainer</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://linuxcontainers.org/" class="">LXC</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://podman.io/" class="">Podman</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://sylabs.io/singularity/" class="">Singularity</a> also exist.
Apptainer and Singularity are designed with a focus on high-performance computing and tend to be well supported and preferred on such systems.
Podman may be seen as a completely free and open-source alternative to Docker.
It has a Docker compatible command-line interface and can run Docker container images.
Apptainer, Singularity and Podman do not need <code>sudo</code> permissions to be run, while up until April 2020 Docker did (please see the <span data-state="closed"><a href="#rr-renv-containers-rootless" class="hover-link">Docker without root access</a></span> section).</p><p>In Docker, the recipe files used to generate images are known as Dockerfiles, and should be named <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://hub.docker.com/" class="">Docker Hub</a> hosts a great many pre-made images, such as
<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu" class="">images</a> of Ubuntu machines, which can be downloaded and build upon.
This makes the process of writing Dockerfiles relatively easy since users very rarely need to start from scratch, they can just customise existing images.
However, this leaves a user vulnerable to similar security issues as described in the <span data-state="closed"><a class="hover-link" href="/reproducible-research/renv/renv-yaml#rr-renv-yaml-security">Security Issues</a></span> of the <a class="" href="/reproducible-research/renv/renv-yaml">YAML</a> sub-chapter:</p><ul><li>It is possible to include malicious code in Docker images</li><li>It is possible for people producing images to unknowingly include software in them with security vulnerabilities</li></ul><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux" class="">This</a> article goes deeper into the potential security vulnerabilities of containers and here is a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://opensource.com/business/14/9/security-for-docker" class="">detailed breakdown</a> of security features currently within Docker, and how they function.
The best advice for using images built by others is, as usual, only download and run something on your machine if it comes from a trusted source.
Docker Hub has “official image” badges for commonly used, verified images as shown here:</p><figure id="docker-official-image" class="fig-figure"><img id="bmbjjhwwfh" style="margin:0 auto" src="/build/docker-official-imag-7ce9a30591709852c8155da4ee7d7297.png" alt="A screenshot of official image badges" data-canonical-url="../../../figures/docker-official-image.png" class=""/></figure><h3 id="rr-renv-containers-installdocker" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Installing Docker</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-installdocker" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Installers for Docker on a variety of different systems are available <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.docker.com/install/" class="">here</a>.

There are only six lines of actual code.
The first of these is a <code>FROM</code> statement specifying a base image.
All Dockerfiles require a FROM, even if it is just <code>FROM SCRATCH</code>.
All the following commands in a Dockerfile build upon the base image to make a functioning version of the researcher’s project.
Specifying a version for the image (<code>18.04</code> in this case) is optional.
However, it is best practice as it ensures that our Dockerfile remains valid after new releases of Ubuntu, which may not include packages (or specific versions thereof) that we require later (for example <code>python3.7</code>).</p><p>It is worth spending time to choose an appropriate base image, as doing so can reduce the amount of work involved in writing a Dockerfile dramatically.
For example, a collection of images with the R programming language included in them can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned" class="">here</a>.
If a project makes use of R, it is convenient to use one of these as a base image rather than spend time writing commands in your Dockerfile to install R.</p><p>The biggest block of lines comes next.
It’s a series of <code>RUN</code> statements, which run shell commands when building the image.
In this block, they are used to install the software necessary to run the project. The first <code>RUN</code> block is a
chain of commands of this form:</p><div class="relative myst-code group not-prose my-5 text-sm shadow hover:shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-stone-200/10"><pre class="block overflow-auto p-3 myst-code-body hljs" style="background-color:unset"><code class="language-text" style="white-space:pre">RUN command_to_do_thing_1 \

The syntax of this command is <code>COPY file_to_copy location_in_container_to_copy_to</code>.
In this example, all the files in the <code>project_files</code> directory are included in the <code>project</code> file in the container.
Note that you can only copy files from the directory where the Dockerfile is located, or subdirectories within it (in the example, that is the
<code>project_files</code> subdirectory).</p><p>The <code>ADD</code> command has the same capabilities as <code>COPY</code>, but it can also be used to add files not on the machine building the image.
For example it can be used to include files hosted online by following <code>ADD</code> with a URL to the file.
It is good practice to use <code>COPY</code>, except where <code>ADD</code> is specifically required, as the term <code>COPY</code> is more explicit about what is being done.</p><p>Here is what happens if a container is opened from an image called <code>book_example</code>, built from the example above:</p><figure id="container-example" class="fig-figure"><img id="Mg6zGATGNU" style="margin:0 auto" src="/build/container-example-b54a97885fb3f12147e7826091e549f5.png" alt="A screenshot of what happens when a container is opened from an image" data-canonical-url="../../../figures/container-example.png" class=""/></figure><p>As you can see, the directory <code>project</code> has been created, and inside the project files, <code>analysis.py</code> and <code>data.csv</code> have been copied into it.

The daemon uses the Dockerfile and its context to build the image.
If the context contains many large files, which are not needed for building the image, (old datafiles, for example) then it is a waste of time sending them to the daemon.
Doing so can make the process of building an image slow.
Files can be excluded from the context by listing them in a text file called <code>.dockerignore</code>.
It is good practice to do so.</p><p>The files do not need to be listed individually in the <code>.dockerignore</code> file.

In fact, Podman provides a Docker-compatible command-line interface.
For most use cases, a user familiar with Docker can simply alias the Docker command to Podman (<code>alias docker=podman</code>) and carry on as normal.
Podman includes a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Commands.html" class="">full set of tools</a> to create, run, manage, and share containers.</p><p>Podman is free and open-source software released under the Apache License 2.0.
This is in contrast to Docker which has some open-source components, such as the engine and command-line interface, but also develops closed-source, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/" class="">subscription<wbr/>-requiring</a> software, including the Docker Desktop clients for MacOS and Windows.</p><p>All <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://opencontainers.org/" class="">Open Container Initiative</a> container images can be used with Podman including Docker images hosted on Docker Hub.
It is likely existing projects using Docker can be migrated to Podman.</p><p>Unlike Docker which uses a daemon running as root, Podman is daemonless.
Unprivileged users can run containers using Podman.
In most cases this will be configured automatically.
This avoids a problem with the standard Docker configuration where users able to run containers have implicit access to the Docker daemon.
The Docker Daemon is run by root by default and provides a trivial way to escalate privileges and get a high level of access to the hosts devices and filesystem.</p><aside class="myst-admonition myst-admonition-note my-5 shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-gray-50/10 dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden myst-admonition-default rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500"><div class="myst-admonition-header m-0 font-medium py-1 flex min-w-0 text-lg text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-900"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="2rem" height="2rem" class="myst-admonition-header-icon inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none text-blue-600"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m11.25 11.25.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Zm-9-3.75h.008v.008H12V8.25Z"></path></svg><div class="myst-admonition-header-text text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words">Note</div></div><div class="myst-admonition-body px-4 py-1"><p>Adding a user to the docker group is essentially giving them a high-level of access to the host with a very simple route to privilege escalation.

As such, it required root access to operate.
There is, however, no reason why the execution of an analysis should require root access for the user.
This is especially important when computations are conducted on a shared resource like high-performance computing (HPC) systems where users will never have root access.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sylabs.io/" class="">singularity</a> container software was introduced to address this issue.
Singularity was created with HPC systems and reproducible research in mind (see <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA87Ba2dpNM" class="">this</a> video).
Singularity containers do not require root access to run.
Root access is normally required to build container images.
However it is possible to build images as a normal user (with some restrictions) using the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/fakeroot.html" class="">fakeroot feature</a>.
This enables users to build container images locally before running them on a high-performance cluster.
As an added benefit, this makes it possible to bring software and project dependencies to an HPC system without requiring the system administrators to install or maintain them.</p><p>Furthermore, Singularity can take advantage of the large Docker ecosystem by building Singularity container images from Docker container images.
Docker images can also be extend by building new images based on docker containers as a base layer.</p><h3 id="rr-renv-containers-singularity-images" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Singularity Container Images</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-singularity-images" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Just as Docker images are built using <code>Dockerfile</code> files, singularity containers are built from singularity definition files.

You must therefore ensure that the application inside the container is compatible with the driver stack on the host.

This makes singularity containers uniquely suited for parallelizing workflows on HPC systems using the widely used <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html" class="">slurm</a> workload manager.
Using singularity, containers and snakemake/nextflow is a way of scaling reproducibility to a massive scale.
Furthermore, as an added benefit, bringing workflows from a desktop machine to an HPC system no longer requires writing custom job submission scripts.</p><h3 id="rr-renv-containers-singularity-storage" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Long-term Storage of Container Images</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-singularity-storage" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>It is important to note that a mere container recipe file is not reproducible in itself since the build process depends on various (online) sources.
Thus, the same recipe file might lead to different images if the underlying sources were updated.</p><p>To achieve true reproducibility, it isimportant to store the actual container <em>images</em>.
For singularity images, this is particularly easy since an image is simply a large file.
These can vary in size, from a few tens of megabytes (micro-containers) to several gigabytes, and are therefore not suited for being stored in a git repository themselves
A free, citable, and long-term solution to storing container images is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://zenodo.org/" class="">zenodo.org</a> which allows up to 50 Gb per repository.
Since zenodo mints DOIs for all content uploaded, the images are immediately citable.
In contrast to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://hub.docker.com/" class="">Docker Hub</a> (which also only accepts docker images),
zenodo is also clearly geared towards long-term storage and discoverability via a sophisticated metadata system.
Thus, it is ideally suited for storing scientific containers associated with particular analyses since these tend to not change over time.</p><h3 id="rr-renv-containers-warning" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Words of Warning</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#rr-renv-containers-warning" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Even though singularity and docker might look similar, they are conceptually very different.
Singularity handles the distinction between the host and container file system differently.
For instance, by default, singularity includes a few bind points in the container, namely:</p><ul><li><code>$HOME</code></li><li><code>/sys:/sys</code></li><li><code>/proc:/proc</code></li><li><code>/tmp:/tmp</code></li><li><code>/var/tmp:/var/tmp</code></li><li><code>/etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf</code></li><li><code>/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd</code></li><li><code>$PWD</code></li></ul><p>Note, <code>$PWD</code> comes in handy since it implies that all files in the working directory are visible within the container.
Binding <code>$HOME</code> by default, however, also implies that software using configuration files from <code>$HOME</code> might behave unexpectedly since the image specific configuration files are overwritten with the current users settings in <code>$HOME</code>.
While this behaviour is handy in HPC scenarios, it is potentially dangerous for reproducible research.
To avoid potential issues, any software installed in a singularity container should be pointed to a global, user-independent configuration file.</p><div></div><div class="flex pt-10 mb-10
