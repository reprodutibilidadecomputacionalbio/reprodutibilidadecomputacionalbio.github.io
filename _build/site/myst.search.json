Such documents are distinguished from machine readable data by virtue of having sufficient structure to provide the necessary context to support the business processes for which they are created. Machine readable data can be defined as data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost.\n\nMain\n\nThe repository’s main branch.

relates to making other aspects of scientific research open to the public such as open educational resources, having inclusive practice and citizen science.\n\nOpen source\n\nopensource.com describes open source as:\n“Something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible”.\nThe concept of ‘open source’ is now often extended beyond the context of its original coinage, \n\nsoftware,\nto other forms of cultural or creative output, such as \n\nhardware and \n\neducational resources.\nReferring to something as ‘open source’ generally means that it is available under an \n\nopen license.\nThe term can also extend to an \n\nopen project philosophy of collaboration beyond the mere availability and open licensing of the project’s source materials.\nThe term tends to, but need not, be applied in contexts where there is some ‘source’ material that is processed or synthesised into an output.\nFor example an image created with a simple bitmap editor might be referred to as ‘open source’ despite lacking something that can be considered a ‘source’.\nIn such cases the notion of a ‘\n\ncreative commons’ or ‘\n\nfree cultural work’ may better apply as these do not as obviously emphasise the availability source materials but rather end products,\nthough they may include source materials.\nThere are also a number adjacent concepts which most often question the conventional open source prohibtion on restricting the uses to which open source things can be put, examples include: ‘\n\nethical source’ and ‘\n\nFair Code’.\n\nOpen source hardware\n\nHardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.\n\nOpen source software\n\nBroadly, users of the software must able to inspect, modify and redistribute the source code of the software as they see fit, and not restrict the uses to which the code can be put or by whom it can be used.\nThe \n\nOpen Source Initiative (OSI) offers a widely used definition of Open Source Software: The \n\nOpen Source Definition (OSD) which is comprised of 10 criteria with which the terms of distribution of software must comply to meet their definition.\nThe OSI maintains a list of licenses which have gone through their review process and been approved.\nOpen source software should not be confused with \n\nsource

Most newspapers are written using plain language.\n\nPositionality\n\nDifferences in social position and power shape identities and access in society. In acknowledging positionality, we also acknowledge intersecting social locations and complex power dynamics (also see: Intersectionality).\n\nPower Users\n\nThese are people who are already familiar enough with a platform to know the gotchas and tricks that make their experience more efficient.\n\nPreprint\n\nA preprint is a version of a scholarly or scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal. It is usually uploaded by the authors to a public server where it is available openly.\n\nPrerequisite\n\nThe prerequisite(s) of a rule correspond to files or other targets in the Makefile that must be up to date before the rule is run.\n\nProject Design\n\nAn early phase of the project where a project’s key features, structure, criteria for success, and major deliverables are all planned out.\n\nPull Request\n\nProposed changes to a remote repository. Collaborators without write access can send a pull request to the administrator with the changes they’ve made to the repo. The administrator can then approve and merge or reject the changes to the main repository. For open source projects pull requests can be sent by anyone that has forked a project.\n\nPush\n\nSending changes to a remote repo. The remote repository is updated with the changes pushed and now mirrors the local repo.","type":"content","url":"/afterword/glossary#p","position":33},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"Q"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/afterword/glossary#q","position":34},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"Q"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/afterword/glossary#q","position":35},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"R"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/afterword/glossary#r","position":36},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"R"},"content":"RDM\n\nAbbreviation for research data management - see research data management for definition.\n\nREADME\n\nA file which contains useful information about a project such as what it is, how to use/install it, how to test it, and how to contribute to it.\n\nRecipe\n\nOne or more shell commands that are executed by Make. Usually these commands update the target of the rule.\n\nRegression Test\n\nComparing the result of a test before and after the code has been altered. If the output has changed a problem has been introduced somewhere in the program, and an error is thrown.\n\nReplicable\n\nA result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.\n\nrepo2docker\n\nA tool to build Docker images from code repositories.\n\nRepository\n\nA central location where resources (data, software, publications or anything else) are stored and accessed. This keyword is often shortened to ‘repo’. See Data Repository if this place is long-lived.\n\nReproducible\n\nA result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.\n\nRendered Output\n\nThis is what the text will look like on an online page in Github or web page\n\nResearch Compendia\n\nThis is a collection of all digital parts of a research project including data, code, texts (protocols, reports, questionnaires, metadata). The collection is created in such a way that reproducing all results is straight forward.\n\nResearch Data Management\n\nAcronym: RDM. Refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing. Shortened to RDM.\n\nResearch Ethics\n\nResearch ethics are the moral principles that govern how researchers should carry out their work. These principles are used to shape research regulations agreed by groups such as university governing bodies, communities or governments. All researchers should follow any regulations that apply to their work.\n\nResearch Objects\n\nResearch objects are living resources aggregating inputs, materials, methods and/or software used in research.\n\nReview\n\nSuggesting changes or asking for committing something to an already created pull request.\n\nRisk\n\nA term that refers to the likelihood and impact of something happening. It’s often used in decision-making contexts to evaluate the potential consequences of actions\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nThis is used to help choose the appropriate sustainable software concepts for your project.\n\nRisk Matrix\n\nA risk matrix is a way of quantifying what’s going on with the thing you’re interested in. One axis measures exposure in some way, and the other the impact of a mishap. The further from the origin, the more safeguards are needed to make the risk acceptable.\n\nRoadmapping\n\nThis is the creation of a roadmap for your project. It is an outline for the work you need to do. It covers your goals, vision and a timeline for tasks.\n\nRobust\n\nA result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.\n\nRule\n\nAn element of the Makefile that defines something that must be built, usually consists of targets, recipes, and optionally, prerequisites.\n\nRuntime Test\n\nTests embedded within the program which are run as part of it.","type":"content","url":"/afterword/glossary#r","position":37},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"S"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/afterword/glossary#s","position":38},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Glossary","lvl2":"S"},"content":"Self Archiving\n\nPlacing a publication or other research outputs in a suitable repository, institutional or subject-based, following the possible restrictions posed by the publisher, for example an embargo period, or limits on the allowed version to be deposited in such archives.\n\nSelf Reflection\n\nActivity of thinking about our thoughts, feelings, emotions, behaviour action, and the reasons that may lie behind them. Taking the time for reflection we can grow our understanding of who we are, what our values are, and why we think, feel, and act the way we do. When we self-reflect and become more conscious of what drives us, we can more easily make changes that help us more easily develop our self or improve our life including the way we conduct research (source: \n\nBerkeley Wellbeing).\n\nSHA\n\nUnique string of numbers of letters used to identify every commit or node in the repository.\n\nShared authorship\n\nSome journals permit the use of group names but many require contributors to be listed and/or the writing group to be named. This is the same as group authorship.\n\nSmoke Testing\n\nVery brief initial checks that ensure the basic requirements required to run the project hold. If these fail there is no point proceeding to additional levels of testing until they are fixed.\n\nSource Available\n\nWhere the source code of a piece of software is made available but not under the terms of an \n\nopen license, you may have to pay to access the source code and agree to terms which prohibit its redistribution, or the code may be generally available and only prohibit commercial redistribution.\nSource available code is proprietary but not closed source.\nWhilst generally used in the context of software it can apply in other contexts such as \n\nopen hardware.\n\nStaged\n\nStaging the changes that will be included in the next git commit.\n\nStochastic Code\n\nCode which, while correct, does not always output the same result. For example a program that outputs ten random numbers will generate a different result each time, despite being correct.\n\nSyntax\n\nThe structure of statements in a computer language.\n\nSystem Testing\n\nA level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system is tested.

Communication styles can also vary, with academia valuing detailed reports and industry favoring concise presentations.\n\nIntellectual property concerns: Sharing research findings openly can be crucial in academia, but industry might have concerns about protecting proprietary information or patentable inventions. Finding a balance between openness and confidentiality is essential.\n\nTime constraints: Academics may juggle teaching, research, and administrative duties, while industry professionals might face tight deadlines and limited time for collaboration. Balancing these commitments can be a hurdle.\n\nVarying levels of expertise: Partners may have different levels of expertise in the collaboration’s domain.

(2019) from the Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science Services \n\n(CORBEL) Project.\n\nIn the case of the Turing-Roche partnership, both the Turing Institute and Roche had a mutual commitment to open science principles which helped shape negotiations and set relatively flexible and collaborative terms around intellectual property.\nThe basis of the partnership was also to develop methodologies, rather than developing products or a collaboration on drug discovery, which would likely complicate contracting and therefore may be something you want to consider.\n\nPlanning a scientific strategy is also a necessity, allowing both sides to identify what is in scope, generating a research agenda and therefore also who should be involved.\nThis also allows you to identify any background intellectual property on either side.\nIt is important to review this scientific strategy on a regular basis and adapt as necessary in response to ongoing research.\n\nFor the Turing-Roche scientific strategy, the partnership approach was to brainstorm potential research topics from both parties to identify areas of common interest.\nFrom this a shared goal was developed to guide the direction of future research as well as a set of principles such as collaboration and open science which the partnership would operate under.\nBased upon these the partnership settled on research areas that fitted the priorities of both organisations.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#cl-academic-industry-establish-setup","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl2":"Governance"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#cl-academic-industry-establish-governance","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl2":"Governance"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#cl-academic-industry-establish-governance","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl3":"Team Charter","lvl2":"Governance"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#team-charter","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl3":"Team Charter","lvl2":"Governance"},"content":"With any collaboration, its important to plan how you’re going to work together.\nA worthwhile initial exercise can be collaboratively drafting a team charter.\nThis document allows you to map out team structure, who is involved from each organisation and their roles and responsibilities within the collaboration.\nThe activity of creating the charter can also allow you to align expectations and reflect on any cultural differences and ways of working.\n\nIn the Turing-Roche partnership, the \n\nteam charter also formed the basis of their governance model.\nThey developed an initial set of meetings which structured decision making processes for the partnership and running day to day activities:\n\nJoint Steering Committee: Occurs twice a year and brings together all senior partnership members to review partnership strategic direction and to make any high level decisions\n\nCore Meetings: Occur monthly and brings together senior partnership members to discuss strategic activities and get high level updates\n\nOperational Meetings: Occur fortnightly and bring together deputy scientific leads and operational team to ensure delivery of partnership activities\n\nThey have since developed other meetings as needed, such as ad hoc strategy meetings to brainstorm new activities, ensuring they are on track for the partnership aims and to consider future opportunities and the legacy of the partnership; lab meetings to bring together the team and all researchers working on the scientific aims of the partnership and facilitate connections; and catch-ups between postdoctoral researchers for sharing preliminary work.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#team-charter","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl3":"Core Team Membership","lvl2":"Governance"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#core-team-membership","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl3":"Core Team Membership","lvl2":"Governance"},"content":"There are a number of considerations for establishing your core team for the collaboration:\n\nHow many people do you want from each organisation?

It is really key to ensure anyone on your core team does have sufficient time to engage with the collaboration as they will be a key driver for your work and also a champion for the collaboration on their side, particularly in the beginning.\n\nFor the Turing-Roche partnership they wanted to ensure parity in their partnership activities, for example ensuring equal representation of Turing and Roche colleagues on interview and funding call panels.\nAny new substantial project as part of the partnership is also drawn up as a project agreement document for signing on both sides, ensuring expectations are set out clearly and there is alignment.\n\nFor the partnership (and indeed most collaborations) project management is essential and the partnership hired a full time project manager for the partnership based at the Turing Institute.\nTheir wide ranging role (from contracting, creating meeting agendas, budgeting, scoping new partnership activities and more) ultimately ensures smooth running of the partnership and that governance is implemented.\nThere is also a project manager colleague engaged on the Roche side which works very well for ensuring consistency.\n\nAdditional resources that may also be of use in these planning stages are the \n\nTuring Way Project Design Guide and the \n\nEthical Consideratons when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model chapter.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#core-team-membership","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl3":"How to Manage Conflict","lvl2":"Governance"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/collaboration/academic-industry/academic-industry-establish#cl-academic-industry-establish-conflict","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Establishing an Academic-Industry Collaboration","lvl3":"How to Manage Conflict","lvl2":"Governance"},"content":"Disagreements are inevitable in any collaboration.

Scheme Personal Story","lvl2":"Motivations and Background"},"content":"Our initial ideas around the scheme were born out of discussions about having more conference representation from the partnership and whether we could run a scheme that funded travel for students to attend conferences.\n\nFrom this discussion, we realised we actually had the capacity to run a scheme where early career researchers could travel to a conference but also engage further with the partnership and run their own community activities.\nIt was also an ideal time to set it up (around two years into the five year partnership), as it meant we had research projects up and running that participants could integrate into their community activities; I think we were not established enough to run the scheme any earlier.\nThe principal benefit of the scheme for us was increasing the reach and engagement of the partnership by working with students in relevant research areas, connecting with their networks and overall bolstering our community.\n\nAt that time, if you wanted to engage with the partnership as an external researcher the main ways you could do this were through our open research funding calls or through existing community activities, such as attending our virtual seminars.\nTherefore, in addition, we also felt this scheme would support me, as the Research Community Manager, to add ways for the growing external community to participate through the new community activities.\n\nLastly, the scheme would be a great opportunity for us as an academic-industry collaboration to play a role in supporting the career development of early career researchers and giving them experience of organisations from two different sectors (academia and industry), which we felt passionate about.\nThis type of cross-sectorial experience is hard to come by for early career researchers and a particular area in need of upskilling, highlighted in various UK government reports, such as the \n\nUK’s National Data Strategy.\nThis also would deliver more tangible impact and legacy for the partnership beyond the research collaboration itself.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ambassador-schemes/ambassador-schemes-personal-story#motivations-and-background","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Turing-Roche Community Scholar

Community Scholar Scheme Personal Story","lvl2":"Scheme Set-up"},"content":"The Turing Institute had a student scheme in place (\n\nthe Enrichment Scheme) but this worked quite differently to what we wanted to do for the scholar scheme, so the set up was as a brand new programme, which with documentation and processes, was a huge undertaking.\nAs with any new project or activity, it was useful to think about what we wanted to achieve with the scheme and work backwards from there to brainstorm how it should work in practice.\n\nWe put together an initial scoping document, ensuring objectives of the scheme were in place and the roles and responsibilities supporting its implementation were well defined.\nWe took this to the partnership leadership team to get some early feedback.\nThe decision was taken to ensure that the activities would be community based, rather than research based due to intellectual property agreements in place between the Turing and Roche.\n\nWe also shared the document with the finance, legal and project management teams at the Turing to understand what details we’d need to provide and finalise for approvals.\nGetting the scheme signed off with each department turned out to be what took the longest in the set-up phase.\n\nWith the finance team, we had initially wanted to open the scheme to PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, however we felt strongly about paying a stipend to the scholars and this proved tricky for people on a non-student contract, so the decision was taken to open to PhD students only.\nWe also settled on only PhD students based in the UK for the same logistical reasons.\n\nWith the legal team, we put in place a framework and discussed issues around data protection, time commitment for students, sign off from their supervisor and using Turing-Roche branding for things that would be made externally available from the community activities.\n\nFor project management, we have a full time project manager working on the partnership, so this was easier to plan with them - we discussed logistics around processing expenses for the scholars and a delivery action plan on how to launch the application process.\n\nOverall approval from all the departments required a lot of documentation on how things would work in practice and how we would navigate any potential issues.\nWhilst this felt like a lot of work up-front, it was actually very helpful down the line to have pre-planned.\n\nThe format we finalised for the scheme was for a year-long programme, welcoming 10 PhD students based at UK institutions.\nThe scholars would embed themselves within the partnership community, attend a relevant conference and undertake a selected, community-based activity, with a £3000 stipend- £2000 paid directly (at the halfway and finish mark) and £1000 to use for conference and project expenses.\nThe scholars would continue their PhD studies whilst being part of the scheme, with the aim of the scheme being a low time commitment of around 3-5 hours a month.\n\nWe felt running the programme on an academic year timeline (September to September) would be helpful for students.\nWe also took the decision not to open up the scheme to students in the first year of their PhD as we felt the time commitment of the scheme may be overwhelming for them.\n\nWe put together various documentation when we opened applications for the scheme, which you can find \n\nhere.\nThese documents include: a call document, FAQs, letters for the university department and students PhD supervisor to sign; so we could ensure they were on board with the student taking part and a student agreement; which sets out responsibilities.\nWe also ran an information webinar with a Q&A session, which was helpful to see the level of interest from registrants and also gave us insights into what we needed to provide more information on.\nWe put a recording of this event on our YouTube channel for anyone who couldn’t attend to make the information more accessible.\n\nWe opened applications for the scheme for 6 weeks over the 2023 June/July period.\nThis was probably the minimum amount of time we would recommend having the applications open.\nFor the application process, we tried to ensure it was fairly light-touch, so as not to overburden the students.\nWe provided some example activities that students could choose in their application, but also gave them the option to apply with one they had designed, with no penalties either way.\n\nWe discussed having an interview process, but in the end decided that we felt the application form would contain sufficient information for us to make a decision.\nThe shortlisting panel was a diverse group from the partnership core team and we used the following criteria to assess the applications:\n\nRelevance (in research/interests/education) - applicant has a good understanding of the partnership research and how their own research is relevant to this\n\nProposal (quality/scope) - applicant clearly identifies how they will put their project into action, how past experience will help with this\n\nMotivations (clear or unclear) - applicant demonstrates clearly why they want to be a Community Scholar, how they will contribute\n\nFor unsuccessful applications, we provided some short feedback and our project manager worked with the successful applicants to execute the necessary legal agreements ahead of the scheme launch which was in September 2023. At the time of writing, we are just over halfway through the scheme.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ambassador-schemes/ambassador-schemes-personal-story#scheme-set-up","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Turing-Roche Community Scholar Scheme Personal

referred to throughout the year.\nAt the virtual group onboarding call, we spent time giving information on how the scheme will work and also scheduled the last portion of the call as breakout rooms for socialising, which we felt was important for the scholars to get to know each other as a cohort.\nWe led with a virtual first approach as our scholars were located across the UK and therefore this was a much more inclusive approach.\n\nIn the weeks after this group onboarding call, we then scheduled individual onboarding calls with each scholar to make sure they were set up on the correct systems (such as our Slack Workspace, Google Drive and our GitHub Repository) and helped them start to plan their activities and set out milestones on \n\ntemplate documents we had prepared.\n\nEvery two months, we scheduled a virtual group cohort call where scholars filled in a document in advance with:\n\nA short activity and conference update\n\nA rose: a line on something that has been going well\n\nA cactus: a line on something that has been tricky/not been going well\n\nAny asks you have for the group\n\nAt the call we would go through this document, encouraging the group to give advice and support to each other.\nThe second half of the call would feature a guest speaker(s) from Turing and/or Roche on a theme we asked for scholars input on.\nSome of the topics we’ve had so far are ‘Advice on how to become a better Data Scientist’, ‘Alternative career paths from the Turing’ and ‘Methods development: collaborations beyond industry’.\n\nIn between these calls, our communication with the scholars was ad hoc as needed.\nTheir main point of contact was me, Sarah McGough, partnership lead from Roche, and our project manager Maria Anagnostopoulou, for logistical queries such as expenses.\nThe scholars could connect with us and with each other through the Turing-Roche Slack Workspace in a dedicated channel and by individual messages.\nWe had online calls with the scholars fairly regularly to support them fully on developing their activities.\nDifferent activities developed at different timescales so we found the support we were providing each scholar wasn’t linear.\n\nThe activities the scholars developed varied widely.\nYou can find the full list of activities \n\nhere, but some examples are a tech-talk event series, a Turing Way chapter on risk of bias, a one day conference bringing together data scientists and pathologists, a health data science podcast and a video animation series explaining partnership research.\n\nFor their sponsored conference, we asked scholars to select one relevant to the partnerships’ research but also to their own studies.\nWe encouraged them to present their research at the conference for experience, but this wasn’t mandatory.\nEach scholar then produced a post conference output to feed back to the community about their experiences.\nAn example blog from our scholar Syafiq Ramlee can be found \n\nhere.\n\nIn terms of communications around the scheme, we announced the launch through a \n\nwebpage and also made the scholars milestone documents and conference tracking document available through our \n\nGitHub Repository.\nIn our monthly partnership newsletter, we also featured a different scholar every month to raise their profile.\n\nAt around the halfway point of the scheme was AI UK; a national conference of data science and AI organised by the Turing.\nThe partnership was exhibiting a demonstration booth at AI UK and we used this as an opportunity to invite the scholars to the conference to meet each other and the partnership team for the first time in-person.\nAfter the conference, we also organised a social event to extend the networking opportunity.\nWe found this a really valuable experience for everyone getting to know each other better and making the cohort feel more cohesive.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the scheme has not finished at time of writing, but we are planning a final in-person celebration event at the Turing to celebrate the scholars’ achievements.\nThe scholars will also be writing a summary of their experiences, which we plan to incorporate in an online yearbook.\nWe also plan to gather formal feedback from the scholars on what we can improve for next time.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ambassador-schemes/ambassador-schemes-personal-story#scheme-in-practice","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Turing-Roche Community Scholar Scheme

Scholar Scheme Personal Story","lvl2":"Learnings"},"content":"Overall, we are really proud of the scheme and very happy we established it.\nIt was hard to predict what we would achieve from our first cohort, but what the scholars have produced through their creative and scientific backgrounds is phenomenal and wouldn’t have been able to be created by our team alone.\nThe success of the scheme has in essence been because it’s mutually beneficial - we have gained outputs that cover the breadth of the partnership and link to our research in a new engaging way, whilst the students have gained new skills and experiences outside of their PhD studies.\n\nA key learning for us is the time commitment for the scheme on both sides.\nIt was really valuable to have two people from the partnership team co-leading for support.\nHaving 10 students was really a bit of a guess on our part as the right number, but we have found whilst this is a small group it was about right for supporting each student and encouraging a cohort feel.\nOn the other side, it’s good to be clear about timings for the scheme for your participants and be wary that they have other commitments.\nThis is also why it’s useful to include activity planning as part of the application process (to get applicants thinking early about what’s feasible in the timeframe) and the milestone plan we developed with students at the start.\n\nFurthermore, if you are having outputs from your participants, think about how and when these will be released.\nIt may be impactful to release everything at the end of your scheme, or in our case a lot of the multimedia outputs we aimed to stagger throughout the year for more individual impact.\n\nA key consideration should be around how to build a sense of community in your cohort, which is always tricky.\nWe found a shared Slack channel really helped for casual ad-hoc communication, particularly as our cohort was virtual first.\nHaving a halfway point in-person meet up also helped a cohort feel, although this is balanced with the advantages of virtual such as accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nOur final bit of advice is to build flexibility into your scheme.\nWhilst planning is a must, we found once the scheme was up and running we did need to make some changes.\nExamples of this being teaming up two scholars for a joint activity to combine their strengths and the aforementioned halfway in-person meet up, which we initially hadn’t planned on but felt like it was a good opportunity.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ambassador-schemes/ambassador-schemes-personal-story#learnings","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chairing

the practice of sharing physical office space with different people who work independently such as remote employees or freelancers.\n\nThis allows people - who may otherwise feel isolated while working alone at home - to use traditional office setups, create a work routine, and build a sense of companionship with others who they share their office spaces with.\n\nIn our Community Handbook, we discuss online coworking calls hosted for The Turing Way community (see the chapter on \n\nThe Turing Way Coworking Calls).\nIt includes our motivation, background, techniques, format, templates, and materials, which can be repurposed and adapted to support your teams and communities by setting up virtual coworking calls for them.\n\nBelow are descriptions of different aspects that one should take into consideration when planning or designing your coworking calls Online.\nThese recommendations can be used for remote or in-person meetings as well with minor changes to adapt to a physical location.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/coworking","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls or Meetings","lvl2":"Designing a format that works for you"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/collaboration/coworking#designing-a-format-that-works-for-you","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls or Meetings","lvl2":"Designing a format that works for you"},"content":"To identify what could be the best format for your coworking calls, you need to think about the following aspects:\n\nPurpose of your coworking calls\n\nAs described in the \n\nmotivation subchapter, we host such events for our community members for building connections, supporting our contributors, onboarding new members and celebrating their work in real time.\n\nYour purpose for hosting coworking calls could be completely different and identifying that is important for you to plan the remaining logistics.\n\nA few other scenarios could be:\n\nIf you work from home, you would like to see your colleagues and stay connected with them through designated coworking schedules.\n\nIf you are working with a distributed group of people on a common project, and if communication and exchange related to the project while working asynchronously is an issue, you can get a lot of your work done over a coworking call.\n\nIf you are working on multiple projects and struggle to focus on one task at a time, coworking can help you put aside a few hours of your time to work with your colleagues who you share the project with.\n\nIf there is a task you are struggling to complete, you can invite support from your trusted colleagues through coworking calls.\n\nTarget audience\n\nIf you already know the purpose of your coworking calls, you will be able to identify who your target audience is.\n\nFor example, if you host your coworking calls for an open source project such as The Turing Way, you can expect your current members, past contributors or even new members of the project to participate.\nIf you are part of a small project, you would expect the same familiar faces in all your coworking calls.\n\nOrganisers and hosts\n\nMany tasks go into organising a coworking call.\nThese tasks can be taken care of by one person like a community manager, project manager, or a volunteer organiser.\nHowever, it is always a good idea to involve more people as co-organisers so that the coworking call still happens even when the main organiser can’t join for any reason.\nTo avoid one person burdening themselves with “not so exciting” organisation issues, you can also decide to rotate the role within the members of your project.\n\nSize of the call\n\nNo matter what the purpose and who the target audience of your calls are, you can decide the size of your call by managing participation by prior registration.\nIf you organise these calls for your project members on a mutually agreed time and with an agenda to work on specific tasks, you can expect most of them to show up.\nIf you keep your call open for any of your community members to join, you may end up having a different number of participants on different calls.\nThis would also mean that for some calls, there won’t be anyone available to co-work with you.\n\nIt’s useful to handle some sort of sign-up sheet or registration system so the organisers know who to expect on the call.\nIn The Turing Way, we use dedicated HackMD notes that can be updated before each call by the participants.\n\nFrequency of these calls\n\nOnce you have identified the purpose, target audience and size of your calls, you can decide how often you would like to host them.\nIf you work with the same group of people, you can host it as per your common availability and at a mutually agreed time on a weekly or monthly basis.\n\nIf the expected participants of your call also work on multiple projects, you might consider regularly hosting it on the same day and time each week or each month.\nThis consistency will allow them to check their availability in advance and block these hours in their calendar.\nThis will also reduce the extra work of coordinating the common availability every time (though you will have to do this in the beginning).\n\nResource availability\n\nBased on the resources available to you, you might have to fine-tune other aspects of your call.\n\nFor example:\n\nShared calendar: If there is a calendar that is updated with a schedule of the coworking calls, people can subscribe to it and indicate their availability.\n\nCommunication platforms: software like Zoom can allow you to connect with many people at the same time. However, you will need a paid subscription (pro account) to control who joins your call (by activating waiting room to avoid Zoom bombing), manage breakout rooms (to allow multiple small groups and discussions) or host longer calls (>40 minutes).\n\nChat system: If you have a group Slack or Gitter channel, information can be exchanged with everyone, including those who can not join the calls but want to offer suggestions or carry out related tasks asynchronously but in coordination with the group.\nThis also allows people to keep each other informed of any last-minute changes such as updated links for joining calls, correct notes, or cancellation of calls.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/coworking#designing-a-format-that-works-for-you","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls or Meetings","lvl2":"Logistics and tasks"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/collaboration/coworking#logistics-and-tasks","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls or Meetings","lvl2":"Logistics and tasks"},"content":"Like any event, coworking calls require planning, organising, hosting and making sure that they happen.\n\nAs the organiser/s of the event, you will be required to:\n\n1. Choose the tools\n\nThe choice in regards to which tools you will use will depend on the purpose and scope of your calls.\nPlease see the subchapter \n\nTools for Remote Collaboration to identify which tools will be most appropriate for communication, chats, shared documentation and scheduling.\n\n2. Plan and host the calls\n\nAs discussed earlier, you will need to agree upon dates and times with people who would like to participate in coworking calls.\nYour calls could be organised on a weekly or monthly basis that consistently takes place on a certain day and time, or it could be organised once in a while by finding a common availability.\n\nOnce you have found a schedule (date, time and frequency), the following tasks will go into planning them:\n\nUpdate the schedule, agenda and calendar to share them with the attendees (or potential target audience). It is also effective when they receive a calendar invite.\n\nMaintain communication (by email, newsletter, or social media) so that everyone is aware of the next calls and the resources available for them to participate.\n\nYour main tasks as a host will be to:\n\nProvide adequate support to the participants so they can make the best of their time.\nIn The Turing Way coworking calls, we find it useful to use breakout rooms when many people are working in small groups or if some people need more discussions, while others want to quietly work on their tasks.\n\nFacilitate shared notes with participants before, during and after the call, so that they can keep track of useful resources or ideas they discuss during the coworking call.\n\n3. Create a safe and accountable space\n\nThough discussed last, this should be your highest priority.\n\nYou should design these calls to make everyone feel welcome, involved and safe.\nIt’s highly recommended to choose a Code of Conduct and put reporting guidelines in place to share with everyone in advance.\nSee this minimal \n\nCoC from Contributor Covenant and an expanded version of \n\nThe Turing Way CoC.\nAdditionally, you should also communicate the basic etiquette, such as muting microphones when not speaking or not interrupting others when working in a Pomodoro session unless necessary.\n\nIt is useful to let everyone know who they can contact if they need help in troubleshooting during the call or need more time to discuss their ideas.\nCreate an agenda that states clearly what is expected of them, such as if they should bring their tasks and questions to the call or communicate them beforehand.\nIn The Turing Way, we have dedicated slots for both group discussions and quiet working.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/coworking#logistics-and-tasks","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls or Meetings","lvl2":"Some

hold accountability for your time and work.\nA small group reduces the burden of coordinating multiple time zones and finding a schedule that is suitable for everyone.\n\nNaomi Penfold and Stefanie Butland have written about their 1:1 coworking format in this post: \n\nOnline Co-working Partnerships are Community of Practice in Action.\nWhile reviewing this chapter, Naomi described their 1:1 call format in contrast with The Turing Way group format as follows:\n\nIn the co-working calls I have, it’s 1:1 and we often spend 20 minutes, in the beginning, catching up and talking about our progress since last time.\nIf there is something we want to discuss more intensely, we allocate 30 minutes of our call time to that, for example, one of us asking the other how to troubleshoot something.\nFor the time in between, we do a few quiet working sessions (sometimes 25 minutes, sometimes longer).\nThis is likely a combination of a co-mentoring call and a co-working Pomodoro call, and it works well for me.\n\nYou can read an adapted version of their blog post along with other ideas for virtual events in the document by Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement \n\nWoodley et al., 2020.\n\nIf you organise or host a coworking call in your community, you are welcome to highlight them in this chapter by creating a \n\npull request on the GitHub

communication tools enable real-time interactions where participants communicate simultaneously via video and voice calls or live messaging and are helpful for immediate feedback and dynamic discussions.\nAsynchronous communication tools enable interactions where responses do not occur in real time, allowing participants to engage at their convenience.\nTools for asynchronous communication include traditional methods like emails and collaborative software platforms  like forums other other messaging platforms where updates and messages can be posted and responded to over time.\n\nThe variety of communication tools used in hybrid work presents challenges for inclusiveness, especially when using asynchronous communication tools.\nPoorly organised hybrid events can isolate online participants, and incorporating communication tools into hybrid collaboration can be complex.\nHybrid meetings require different etiquette, and unequal access to communication tools may exclude some individuals, especially those at early career stages who might still be exploring navigating such

set of principles, practices, and skills people can use to mobilise their communities to solve shared problems and achieve shared goals” (See \n\nMozilla Open Leadership framework).\n\nThe Open Organisation Resources defines open leadership as a mindset and behaviors that anyone can learn and practice.Their roles may not be permanent or predestined but emerge as needed for the task at hand.\nOpen leaders uphold transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community.\n\nThe Open Leadership Framework states that leadership is about involving members and mobilising communities to solve problems and achieve goals that are beneficial for everyone.\n\nIndividuals who lead their work (project, organisation, communication, resources) openly design different aspects of their work to promote openness and social good throughout their work life cycle.\n\nThe key principles of openness are: design, build, and empower for understanding, sharing, and participation and inclusion.\n\nDesign: You plan projects for contributors and users’ specific needs and capacities.\n\nBuild: You create systems and solutions that maximize a project’s clarity, usability, and inclusiveness.\n\nEmpower: You help contributors own the work through transparency, accountability, and shared decision-making.\n\nThe emphasis is on ensuring that the members of an open project understand the project so well that the project can run without leaders because all the members are empowered to take on leadership tasks.\n\nThe Turing Way is built upon Open Leadership principles, which involve and support its members to apply these principles when developing content for its book or supporting its community.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/leadership#open-leadership-framework","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Leadership in Data Science","lvl2":"Understanding Leadership in Data

decisions across all sectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Words that stand out in a word cloud from \n\nthe Wikipedia entry about leadership.\n\nTheoretical frameworks from business schools, executive training and resources often explain, define, or assess leadership skills as traits such as “popularity, power, showmanship, or wisdom” which are not the essence of leadership (\n\nHarvard Business Review).\nThere is no such thing as a fixed set of leadership skills and not all great leaders have the same traits, strengths or \n\nleadership styles.\n\nIn the context of data science, where we strive to advance our knowledge through validated scientific methods based on data, talking about leadership, essentially a nuanced and fuzzy concept, is challenging to define.\nIn data science and research, discussions and upskilling in leadership are extremely important as:\n\nResearchers and data scientists constantly navigate fast-changing demands of ‘innovative’ approaches in technological development.\n\nThey manage and coordinate collaborations with their peers as well as external stakeholders across multiple disciplines.\n\nLeadership is one of the toughest non-technical skills to learn without guidance.\n\nLeadership is rarely discussed openly in research environments, despite being everywhere.\n\n(Open) Leadership is one of the keys to healthy and inclusive communities that we are striving to build in data science.\n\nIn this chapter, we explore different aspects of (open) leadership skills that are applicable in the data science and research contexts.\nAfter all, “technical skills are just one aspect of making data science research open, reproducible, inclusive and ethical for all” (as stated in the \n\nWelcome page of The Turing Way).\n\nWe hope that by discussing leadership here, we will:\n\nSpotlight on important points that everyone in research should know\n\nInspire those who think leadership is not for them to review their assumptions (and maybe see themselves with abilities to lead a project).\n\nIgnite reflection and spark conversations about the leaderships we want to promote in data science.\n\nEvaluate if leadership in our workplace or communities are healthy, compassionate, and inclusive, and how we can improve it.\n\nIn this chapter, we will introduce and discuss:\n\nimportant features of leadership when experiencing and exercising them in data science,\n\nwhat we mean by \n\n\"healthy\" leadership, how we can build open and healthy leadership approaches and what they should avoid/address,\n\nhow we can create \n\nleadership opportunities in our projects,\n\nfinally, our community members provide examples of open leadership from their own professions and experiences.\nWe invite you, the diverse group of

Skills","lvl2":"Some Important Skills that Leaders Should Build"},"content":"Leading by example: Leaders take initiative. They demonstrate what something looks like in practice.\nTheir examples combined with clear directions for what needs to be done create opportunities for others to follow.\nThey support their team members to take on specific roles while working alongside each other.\nThey support them to identify new ideas and opportunities while working towards a shared goal, rather than telling them constantly what to do.\n\nChampioning Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility (EDIA):\nGood leaders champion EDIA in their teams and workplace.\nThey actively learn and build an understanding of how to operationalise EDIA in project goals.\nIdeally, EDIA is embedded in the work culture so it doesn’t become another item on the checklist, or given inadequate resourcing and attention.\nLeaders play a critical role in ensuring that EDIA efforts in the ways of working of a team as well as the work they do are intentional and meaningful.\nOpen and emergent leaders understand that research and communities are political, with members from various identities, backgrounds and political interests, who are affected by the social discourse.\nTherefore, they learn to hold safe spaces to have discussions and respond to the need for culture change with the members affected or oppressed by the status quo.\nLeaders should build crucial \n\nally skills to learn how to use their privileges to step up for others in the teams.\n\nEnsuring Diversity: Diverse teams are high-performing teams.\nData science and research projects are no exception to supporting diverse teams.\nDiverse teams are indispensable and inherently essential for ensuring benefits for people impacted by the processes and outcomes.\nEmpathic and effective leaders understand the importance of diversity, build diverse teams and centre the interests of marginalized interests in their projects and work.\nGood leaders respect and celebrate cultural differences and welcome everyone by providing inclusive approaches and policies.\nThis means understanding that people come from different cultural background and lived experiences and have different preferences or style of working (reference: \n\nThe Culture Map).\nLeaders should be intentional in designing projects and teams’ ways of working to embed practices that welcomes and include all stakeholders.\nIf there are certain limitations for including specific groups of people such as external stakeholders, this should be clearly recorded and communicated.\nBeing kind, examining assumptions, and keeping an open mind to learn from the variability that enriches teams are essential to be a good leader.\nNo one in a team, group, organization, or event should have to speak too loudly to get their message across.\n\nTransparency and accountability: Healthy leadership makes decisions as transparent as possible and builds accountability within the team.\nThis means that everyone is involved in the decision-making and feedback process, and kept updated on the status of the group’s work.\nIt also means avoiding unpleasant surprises and uncertainties, and ensuring clear expectations for everyone’s behaviour through participation guidelines and Code of Conduct.\nHuman relationships are complicated, and leaders must make consensus-led decisions, however, sometimes those decisions may not align with the scope and goals of the project.\nThis is where providing a clear governance process can help leaders in avoiding arbitrary decision-making, bring alignments and enable transparent governance.\n\nContinuous knowledge and skill building: Leaders have deep knowledge of their projects and teams, and continue to build skills for themselves and others as needed.\nThey bring systems-level thinking and familiarity with the whole organisation where they lead, and the system within which they work with.\nLeaders’ goals also include identifying opportunities for and directly building complementary skills for the entire team, encouraging problem-solving as a team, developing a workflow that enhances the efficiency of the team (for example reusable and reproducible processes), and sharing knowledge with each other.\nAt the core of this is building diverse teams, bringing perspectives from diverse cultural backgrounds, and working with them to solve problems faster.\n\nConsensus: Leaders act on as much consensus as possible, even when they do not agree with the decision individually.\nA healthy way to navigate the difference is to create spaces to have informed conversations where multiple perspectives are explored and the team can assess the pro and cons of each possible decision.\nThis also means that leaders provide a process for how decisions are made, and invite inputs from their team members on improving the process further.\nSometimes it may mean that they need to reach out to the people who don’t actively engage, or feel left out of the consensus to make decisions that are best for the maximum number of people affected by them.\n\nTrust: Healthy leadership trusts in the skills and ability of people around them and identifies the best fit roles or tasks for everyone to succeed.\nThey are aware of their own biases and avoid them intentionally, often by providing space to listen to different thoughts and perspectives.\nThey support people to \n\nnavigate and manage changes by helping them understand where they stand in relation to coming changes particularly when leading large projects, with many moving parts and teams.\n\nDelegation: Leaders should lead by example, but they will be unable to do everything themselves and should not do everything either.\nWhen a leader is in charge of too many aspects of a project they will become a bottleneck and blocker to the emergence of other open leaders as well as the overall progress of the project.\nDelegation goes hand in hand with building a trustworthy environment, this means that they communicate clearly the overarching goals, create smaller milestones, and delegate tasks meaningfully so different people can lead different parts of the work, nurturing healthy leadership habits within their teams.\n\nUnderstanding of power dynamics: Power dynamics are relationships between people in an organisation with varying levels of privileges.\nLeaders hold power because of their position in the project (formally or socially) and hence have significant influence over how those power dynamics are experienced or manipulated in their teams and communities.\nLeaders with formal authority come with institutional power and open leaders often come with informal connections that can translate into social capital or power (even when they don’t have formal authority in the organisation).\nTherefore, leaders should understand how their positions affect the dynamics when working with others in their team, even when not overtly exerting their power.\nUnderstanding power dynamics helps leaders identify and resolve conflict, build consensus, and create a more effective team culture.\n\nAcknowledging fairly: Leadership roles come with a lot of visibility.\nThis is partly earned by leaders’ work as individuals but is often enhanced by the work of others in their teams.\nOpen leaders recognise and celebrate all kinds of work, appreciate and celebrate them openly and give appropriate credit to everyone, including those who take on invisible responsibilities for the sake of the projects’ overall success.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/leadership/leadership-building#some-important-skills-that-leaders-should-build","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Building Healthy Leadership

Leadership Skills","lvl2":"What Should Leaders Avoid"},"content":"Elitism and hypocrisy: Open leadership in research in general benefits a lot from equity, inclusivity and diversity (EDI).\nThus, traits that sabotage EDI goals, should be avoided at all costs.\nAttitudes like elitism and hypocrisy can have unintended consequences on the project as well as on the leaders themselves.\nElitism is when leaders constantly reinforce their authority, status, and expertise, creating distance between themselves, experienced team members, and junior or newer members.\nHypocrisy is when leaders hold their team members to a different standard than that to which they hold themselves.\nLeaders should hold the same standards for everyone and create spaces for collaboration through egalitarian rather than authoritative means.\n\nIgnoring the personal side of the team: People have multiple sides of their lives and only part of it might be visible when they contribute to a project or team.\nLeaders should set an environment where their team members feel safe to disclose as much or as little they want from their personal lives.\nBut it is up to the leader to ensure that their team members feel safe to express the issues that affect their work such as their physical or mental health, and understand each others’ challenges, such as those caused by invisible or visible disability or caring responsibilities outside work.\nThey should also ensure people know where and how to ask for help, whether that help comes from colleagues or professionals.\nIf leaders don’t make it ok for their team members to share their challenges, team members, particularly newer members, will not know what is appropriate and won’t ask for help even when they need it.\nThis will likely have a negative impact on the overall project/team/organisation dynamics, decrease opportunities for building trust, and affect people’s mental health, which may result in burnout.\n\nTunnel vision: Leaders should be aware of the research landscape, trends, and state-of-the-art technology/approaches relevant to their teams.\nEven if the organisation or a project might focus on one line of work, awareness about and an understanding of what is ‘going on around’ at the broader level help create a better direction for the project.\nThey engage their team members and engage them in discussions that go beyond finding quick solutions.\n\nHide weaknesses: Weaknesses should be something we should embrace and work on, not something to hide - especially leaders.\nLeaders should not put unrealistic expectations on their team members to know everything, unicorns do not exist!\nInstead, they should encourage complementing skillsets and create teams where everyone can learn from and build on each others’ skills.\nSometimes people’s strengths can be their ‘weaknesses’ in other situations, and vice versa.\n\nMicromanage: Leaders don’t try to personally control and monitor everything that their team members do.\nInstead they learn to delegate, ask what their team members need and trust that their team members would complete the task assigned to them.\nThey should be available to talk to without interfering with the work directly and slowing the operation down.\n\nTrying to be a leader everywhere: The same person should not be a leader everywhere.\nPeople in one or several lead positions would ideally leave room for others to take on leadership positions.\nGood leadership takes a lot of time.\nIt is often not possible to lead well if you are leading several projects.\nLeadership and limited time allocation are often incompatible.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/leadership/leadership-building#what-should-leaders-avoid","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Building Healthy

projects or spaces (professional or personal), they will likely have overlapping interests.\nBased on the nature of their roles in those projects, the nature of their relationship with different project teams (sometimes with overlapping groups of people) will differ.\nIt is the core responsibility of individuals to identify and declare their conflicts of interest proactively.\nThey should make it clear in what capacity or in what role (from the multiple ‘hats’ they wear) they are operating.\nThey should separate the conversations to avoid confusion for people they work with and if needed, they should step away from a situation, transferring the leadership responsibilities to others.\nIt is also important to remember that you may have different levels of power depending on which “hat” you’re wearing - for example, as a friend, you might be entitled to ask someone things about on a personal level that would be inappropriate to ask if you are acting as their manager.\nIn

leaders to embrace the changes and evolve our planned strategy as leaders based on what seems sensible and needed to facilitate/guide/lead the team towards their shared goals.\nA \n\nsummary by Forbes Lab describes emergence as practical instead of theoretical.\nBrown’s definition of emergence comes from Nick Obolensky: “Emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity

structurelessness is by bringing governance, policies, or rules in writing accessible to everyone.\n\nGovernance is the set of formal and informal practices through which an organisation sets goals, assigns responsibilities, establishes systems, and assesses outcomes of organisational action (find theoretical details in the \n\nHandbook of Economic Organization by Grandori, A.

scenarios with the same effectiveness.\nHowever, individuals can learn some specific traits and adapt these traits as needed in a given situation.\n\nGreat leaders in one project or environment, say a data science journal club, may not be leaders in other contexts such as leading a research project independently.\nIt doesn’t mean that specific skills required for a specific profession can’t be learned.\nLeaders must bring humility and understand where their knowledge might be limited.\nNo matter how many books about leadership a person reads or how many (often expensive) workshops a person attends to learn how to become a leader, no method will guarantee leadership at all times in all contexts.\nTherefore, in new contexts, leaders should give space to people who are closer to the situation/problem and may have a better understanding of their environment and needs.\nIndeed, trying to become the leader of too many projects or in all contexts is often one of the aspects to avoid in healthy leadership as we mention in the next subchapter.\n\nThe final takeaway here is that learning to become a good leader is a creative process that one can also learn through practice and willingness to learn from failures.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/leadership/leadership-features#leaders-are-made-not-born","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Creating Leadership

opportunities can emerge, it can be helpful to create clear pathways to invite individuals to lead, acknowledge their work and formalise their roles.This can be done by inviting people for individual contributions and facilitating a culture where people feel empowered and trusted to lead when opportunities arise.\n\nOnce a community or project team has grown to a certain size, a more formal structure can help to ensure leadership responsibility scale accordingly to keep everyone supported.\nBeing clear about the roles people can take on and the commitment that is expected from them will allow people to manage expectations around skills, workload, and responsibilities.\n\nOne way to do this is to have people commit for a certain period and re-evaluate leadership regularly.\nThis allows active leaders to reflect on their contributions and offboard if necessary and is an opportunity to identify if more or other community members have emerged and should be formally recognised for their work.\n\nIn the context of data science, in The Turing Way we have discussed the \n\nResearch Infrastructure Roles describing the roles of members in a research team who provide specialised skills, expertise and services required for effectively carrying out and delivering high-quality research.\nYou can explore the chapter in detail, which spotlights the roles of Research Community Managers, Research Applications Managers, Research Engineers, Data Stewards, Data Wranglers, Project Managers and more as open leaders.\n\nFor community projects, The Carpentries’ community leadership

backgrounds and levels of experience.\nIt is then their responsibility to mentor and support them, and create a path for them to excel and grow in their roles.\n\nNurturing these next-generation leaders requires building trust through authentic connections, and providing opportunities for upskilling.\nProviding the right level of support while challenging and nudging their team members

Contributions","lvl2":"Guidelines for Review Process and Maintenance"},"content":"For project collaboration on GitHub, it is important to follow a defined guideline with best practices for maintaining a particular project.\nThe maintenance process can be executed smoothly with the help of the following:\n\nDocumenting the process: A comprehensive documentation on how contributors can get started with the project and how they can make meaningful contributions is the first step to be taken while maintaining an open source project.\nThese details should throw light on what the project is all about, why was it created in the first place, who maintains the project, what the community culture looks like, and who can provide guidance to new contributors.\n\nThese three documents are a good start towards building these documents:\n\nA project should contain a \n\nREADME.md file that provides the important details and links to resources that one must know to become a member of the project.\n\nA Code of Conduct (see The Turing Way \n\nCode of Conduct) must be provided in every project to establish that a welcoming and safe environment for community members while collaborating.\n\nA well-written contribution guideline (see The Turing Way \n\nContributing file) is extremely important when the collaboration is done remotely on any project to ensure clear communication between contributors and maintainers.\n\nEffective communication: The conversations regarding any contribution can be made public for others to join for a discussion while working on small features and ideas.\nThis will involve more people and ensure transparency in open source work.\nIt is important to write messages and comments on the issue and pull requests, in a clear and easy to understand manner while doing a review to help the contributors in understanding the requirements so that they can make better commits to their pull requests.\nIt is better to mention important links in the messages if required.\n\nMentored contributions: The maintainer’s role is to make the contribution a process as easy as possible.\nOpen source contributions can be intimidating for a lot of new contributors.\nGuiding people by making friendly and encouraging conversations can make the onboarding process for new contributors comfortable.\nIt is better to create descriptive issues to resolve.\nFor significant contributions to be made, it is better to create different issues before resolving them with pull requests.\nLabeling issues and pull requests will help in getting more contributors involved in various tasks with different skill requirements.\nLabeling seemingly easy issues as \n\n“good first issue” will help new contributors to pick up easy tasks like minor changes in code and content, bug and typo fixes and small design issues.\n\nMaintaining the pull requests: The maintenance of already existing pull requests on a project involves labeling them, reviewing them, changing their stages, merging and closing them.\nMaintenance of pull requests can be done by giving the right review at the right time.\nOn GitHub there are various ways to provide feedback while reviewing such as by giving feedback as a comment on the pull request, suggesting changes while reviewing, directly proposing changes in the branch of the contributors or discussing on the pull request how the contributions can be improved (see this \n\nGitHub post for details).\nMaintainers may communicate a timescale within which they review and merge pull requests for an active project, for example, one week.\nThe labels can be changed over time and phases to correctly reflect the status of a feature under development.\n\nAcknowledging other’s work and respecting time: Welcoming people who contribute to a project is one of the keys to make a collaborative project a success.\nWhenever a meaningful contribution is made and a PR is merged, maintainers should acknowledge it.\nA small message saying “Thank you” is often enough, especially for newbies in open source spaces.\nIt is always a good gesture to give credit to contributors in open source by adding them to the contributor’s list.\nThe best way to do that is to create a dedicated file where all the contributors are mentioned with their contributions made in the projects.\nIf the project contributors are based in different parts of the world, the maintainers should be respectful towards their time and schedule work accordingly.\nIn case someone is not able to discuss ideas because of

look for ways to use our skills to solve pressing, current issues.\n\nThe most recent example is the COVID-19 pandemic and related events \n\nWorld Health Organisation, 2020 worldwide including the global lockdown that started in February 2020.\nThe research communities responded with a sudden surge of hackathons, data modelling projects, task forces, and working groups to find effective and immediate technical solutions to combat this health crisis.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Decolonising Knowledge through inclusive and collaborative approaches. The Turing Way Community, & Scriberia. (2020, November). Illustrations from the Turing Way book dashes. Zenodo. \n\nCommunity & Scriberia (2020)\n\nSuch action-oriented efforts result from a motivation to pull together and combine our scientific knowledge to address unprecedented situations, which is surely an ideal way to move forward.\nNevertheless, forming effective collaborations is a challenging process, even in the best of times.\nKeeping a team engaged is a continuous activity that requires regular checking in and evaluation.\nBased on each evaluation we can change and improve our workflow and community practices.\nHowever, when we hastily create a project to tackle an immediate problem at hand, we don’t have the benefit of time to carry out such an evaluation.\nTherefore it is even more important to be intentional when creating teams and communities and apply the tried and tested best practices from the beginning.\n\nSo, how can we ensure that the teams and research communities we form during the time of urgency are built on the foundation of excellent science and community practices?\nTo help researchers address this issue, especially when starting a community or a team-oriented project in a short amount of time (such as a pandemic), we have compiled recommendations drawn from the experiences of community and technical experts.\nIn this chapter, we discuss the important aspects that help make a project truly productive, while being successfully community-oriented.\nWe also discuss useful ways to tackle technical issues that can arise in a project.\nIn the third subchapter, we urge our readers to identify their stakeholders, actively invite them to participate and value the differences that exist in their teams and communities.\n\nWe hope that the practices recommended in this chapter will give a good starting point for building successful collaboration with your team and community.\nWe want to prompt everyone to think critically not just about the technicalities of the work, but also the social environment in which it is being conducted.\n\nThis chapter was originally discussed and written in \n\nan online post by Malvika Sharan, Yo Yehudi, Colin Sauze, Raniere Silva, Caroline Jay, Robert Haines and Claire Wyatt as a part of the \n\nCollaboration Workshop 2020 speed blog series hosted by \n\nSoftware Sustainability

is important to create a supportive environment where anyone can ask for clarification without feeling looked down upon.\n\nAdditionally, provide access to resources whenever you can to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to gain a common understanding.\nFor example, if your project idea is based on a recent peer reviewed paper that is behind the paywall, members from low income institutes

Background"},"content":"This chapter is meant to serve as a resource to support and guide researchers, organisers, and community members with the tools to identify the opportunities and mitigate barriers in the organisation of events that involve and include members of the public, and in particular people with lived experience.\n\nWe refer to “people with lived experience” throughout this chapter as a way to recognize and acknowledge individuals who have direct personal knowledge, or firsthand experience of a particular situation that is relevant to the topic of a research-related event.\nFor example, this could relate to a particular medical condition, disability, or other social condition.\nIt is a term often used to emphasise the importance of including the perspectives and insights of those who have had direct experience. \n\nHealth & Research, 2021\n\nCoalition, 2022.\n\nThis chapter is focused in particular on how to make research events more inclusive and accessible to members of the public and people with lived experience who do not have experience or a background as a researcher, as they can face particular barriers to participation.\n\nMany research projects are increasingly including members of the public in the research process.\nWithin the realm of biomedical and care-related research, this is often referred to as “Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement” or “PPIE” which has a goal to actively involve people with the lived experience of a specific disability, situation, health condition, or experience in the research process. \n\nUK, 2023.\nPPIE is done both to ensure that research is aligned with the interests of people affected by it, and to improve the quality of research by including lived knowledge and perspectives.\nAs part of this involvement and engagement, researchers and research staff will need to plan events that are inclusive and accessible for people with lived experience, and delivered in a way that avoids presenting barriers to people with lived experience taking part equitably.\n\n“Lived experience” as it is used within the research context can be a range of things such as a disability, long-term health condition, bereavement, having worked in a specific profession, or the lived experience of caring responsibilities.\n“Lived experience” is an expansive and inclusive term preferred by many patient and public representatives as it best reflects the diverse community of contributors and the expertise they have.\n\nIn the context of event planning, there are practices researchers and organizers can use to foster the participation of this diverse group of people.\n\nThus, considerations need to cover both the potential disability-related barriers experienced by your attendees as well as the barriers that would be experienced by your attendees with lived experiences such as parental responsibilities, cultural differences, or minority status.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the latter aspects, specific to involving people with lived experiences, for the more general and equally important considerations around accessibility – that affect participants regardless of whether they are members of the public or not, please refer to specific accessibility or access-centered resources.\n\nBecause both internal resources and the events you run can range in size - from small meetings to massive multi-day conferences - this chapter is not an exhaustive list and instead is meant to provide general guidance.\nIt offers a starting point to adapt the suggestions made by this chapter to align your event with the needs of your specific community and attendees.\n\nThis chapter and its guidance have been built by the contributions of the Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement Community of Practice with the \n\nAI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Project project.\nThis community consists of patients, clinicians, researchers, and members of the public with an expertise of living with multiple long term conditions.”","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events#cl-ppie-events-background","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for

when to communicate around your event is always important, but it can be even more relevant when inviting people with lived experience – who might be new to research events – to your own event.\n\nThis section provides guidance on what to consider when developing a communications plan for events involving people with lived experience.\nIt will not be able to replace an in-depth communications plan, but instead draws attention to what additional considerations may be needed to help make your event inclusive of people with lived experience.\nPlease refer to the \n\nPlanning your Event section for more information about planning your event.\nYou can find a checklist at the end of this page for what key pieces of information need to be included in your event’s core communications.\n\nFor this chapter, “Communications” refers to the information you share with potential attendees, the timings and schedule on which you communicate it, the channels you will use, and the content and information about the event.\n\nWhen developing a communications strategy, in addition to identifying the goals for your event, you will need to consider:\n\nWho are you trying to reach?\n\nWhy are you trying to reach them?\n\nWhat information do you need to include?\n\nWhen do your attendees with lived experience need the information?\n\nHow will you convey the information to them?\n\nWhat forms of communication does your target audience use (social media, email, in-person meetings)?\n\nDepending on the scale and resources for your event, your communications plan may include the development of websites, PDFs, flyers, banners, and social media posts in addition to email and calendar invites.\n\nBy carefully planning out what you need to communicate, when, and how you ensure that the information is received and understood, your attendees will be supported in spending their effort and energy taking part in your event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE Events","lvl2":"When to send Core

planning an event attended by people with lived experience, please be mindful that many people with lived experience might require information with more notice in order to plan their

event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-comms-timeline","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE Events","lvl3":"Save

you will be able to finalize accessibility information and a reimbursement policy.\n\nFor people with lived experience who are attending your event, Save the Dates serve to give the advance notice required for attendees to plan and give notice that they will be attending your event.\nFor example, many professions require at least 2 weeks advance notice to process and approve leave to support a person taking time off work to attend your event, or people with caregiving responsibilities may need to arrange alternative care to support their attendance.\n\nAdditionally, many people with lived experience of disabilities or medical conditions need to carefully plan their attendance as part of managing their condition, especially for in-person events.\nThis can be due to medication requirements, and managing conditions that involve fatigue or overstimulation as well as figuring out a plan for how they will manage physical barriers to arriving at an in-person event.\n\nProviding clear and timely information will help your attendees with lived experiences plan their attendance safely, and in a way that supports them engaging fully in your event.\nThis will also be supportive of attendees with busy schedules who may be booked out significantly in advance.\n\nYour “Save the Date” should include an overview of honorarium or reimbursement support, the date, and the approximate location of the event such as Zoom, or the name of the city where the event will take place.\nIt should also reference how long the event is likely to be, for example, if it’s a multi-day event or a few hours.\n\nBy providing guidance along with a “Save the Date”, your attendees would have appropriate time to be able to make arrangements, and also be able to make an informed choice about if they are able to attend.\n\nConsider sending out different forms of a “Save the Date” to support how different people use and interact with online calendars.\nFor example, depending on your attendees you may need to:\n\nsend out an online calendar placeholder,\n\nsend an email invitation written in plain language with simple formatted headings,\n\nattach an accessible PDF flyer with “Save the Date” information to any emails,\n\nand promote the “Save the Date” information through your usual communication channels such as Slack, LinkedIn or organization’s newsletter, website, and social media.\n\nThis can ensure that people who use different communication channels are able to receive the information in a medium that is accessible to them and through the channel they are most comfortably using.\n\nCase Study\n\nThe \n\nPublic and Patient Involvement and Engagement Community for people with experience of Multiple Long-Term Conditions had asked event organizers to send out both calendar invitations compatible with Outlook and Google calendars, and email invitations.\n\nThis was to support the community members who often needed to manage event attendance around medical appointments, as well as support those who had visual impairments and would benefit from digital tools providing reminders.\n\nIn several of the group’s community meetings, attendees expressed that they would not regularly check emails and instead would rely on their calendars, however, some members of the community expressed the opposite and did not use digital calendars but would download and print out flyers for their notice boards.\n\nBy adjusting communication to include both these requests, organizers were better positioned to engage people with lived experience.\nThey were also more successful in involving underrepresented people in community events.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-save-the-date","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE

invited to.\nAdditionally, the terms “researcher” and “scientist” may carry many stereotypes such as people wearing lab coats, tweed jackets, or formal robes.\n\nIt can be helpful to surface tacit information, such as what to wear, in your event information to help all attendees feel comfortable and to dispel any assumptions people may have about what a “scientist” looks like.\n\nConsider communicating if there is an expectation of business, business casual, or other dress code and if your event will host any particular social events that may require a different dress code.\nFor example, closed-toed shoes in a museum, or modest dress for a sacred site.\n\nAlso, consider including a short description of what that specific dress code means.\nYou can include examples or reference images if it is particularly important to be dressed a certain way, for example, a research event that may be visited by a Royal Family or other dignitary.\n\nWhere possible at your event, support the adoption of a casual dress code.\nBusiness or Formal wear can be cost-prohibitive and inaccessible to those with mobility difficulties or sensory processing differences.\n\nDress Code Differences\n\nWhat to wear to research events can often differ greatly between fields.\nFor example, some prominent researchers and a Nobel laureate have become known for not wearing shoes and avoiding formal wear at events.\nBy making clear expectations and supporting people with lived experience attending your event, you are also helping make your event more inclusive and welcoming to all

in your invited speakers and event facilitators.\n\nWhen inviting a speaker with lived experience to present, consider what barriers exist that would prevent their full participation in the event.\nFor example, you may need to provide details about the event ahead of when the information is scheduled to be sent to researchers or participants who are not speaking.\nThis is to ensure that the speaker can engage without barriers and make an informed decision about participation while leaving enough time for planning and finding alternative speakers.\n\nAsk your speakers what accessibility practices would facilitate their participation, communicate your decisions about accessibility practices, and collaborate with speakers to ensure that they can deliver their session effectively.\n\nAdditionally, when inviting a speaker or facilitator with lived experience, consider asking how they wish to be identified in relation to their expertise and experience.\nFor example, many autistic people, and the autistic community as a collective, have expressed a preference for using “Identity-first” language which places the disability first in the description.\nThis is contrasted with “Person-first” language which emphasizes the person before the disability, for example, _Person with epilepsy.\nPeople may wish to be referenced as “expert by experience” or by the phrase we have used in this chapter “person with lived experience”.\nThis can be an incredibly person and important distinction for many people so it important that you ask and clarify with your speakers ahead of time.\nMany people feel strongly about person or identity first language, and it is important to ask that individual about their preference as part of planning their introduction.\n\nYou may notice that both person-first and identity-first language has been used in this chapter.\nHow a person chooses to self-identify is entirely a personal decision, and it is the role of organizers and facilitators to support the choices of the speakers and attendees, as long as it does not contravene the event’s Code of Conduct.\nConsider instead including a statement on the inclusive and compassionate use of both person-first and identity-first language when opening your event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-comms-speaker-diversity","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE

presenters on inclusive communication, and requesting that any content delivered in the session can be sent to attendees before the event.\n\nIf your event has online or streamed sessions, consider developing an information pack and working with your speakers and event facilitators to ensure that content is accessible and inclusive of all attendees.\nYou can use this pack to highlight information about the audience that the speaker should know, and provide guidance on how to effectively communicate to an audience of people with lived experience.\nIn this resource, you can model how to talk with respect about the people with the type of lived experience that is the topic of your event, using the vocabulary the community chooses and avoiding assumptions related to that topic.\nMany early career researchers may not have received formal training in scientific communication and working with the public, so it can be helpful to emphasize the importance of using plain language and speaking clearly.\n\nYou can also prepare the speakers by asking how they would like to interact with any questions that are asked.\nMany research talks often follow a “lecture” format where a speaker talks on a topic and then takes 2-3 questions from the audience.\nConsider asking your speaker to break their talk into sections to allow for questions at different points in the session, or if your event is a lecture, consider using software to gather questions as the session progresses.\nThis can be helpful for people with lived experience of cognitive or sensory

be helpful in your communications to state who will be in attendance.\nFor example “researchers, clinicians, experts by experience, policymakers, and funding bodies”.\n\nFinally, consider including short introductions and background information about the speakers and session facilitators in your event information.\nMany people with lived experience may feel more comfortable engaging in an event

speakers and presenters to finalize session content before the event.\n\nBy working with speakers and requesting slides and presentation content ahead of the event, you will be best set up to support the involvement of people with disabilities and lived experience at your event.\n\nThis can help in two core ways:\n\nsupporting speaking in developing both psychologically and physically accessible content,\n\nensuring that your event’s content is accessible to a diverse audience.\n\nFirstly, consider how you will support speakers in developing inclusive material that is pitched to the correct audience, which in this case will be members of the public and people with lived experience.\nThis may mean developing and sharing guidance on session content, or could also be giving feedback on presentation drafts.\nEnsure that you contact and confirm your speakers with enough notice that allows them to prepare and revise material.\n\nSecondly, it is best practice to send out content before the session or event to ensure that people with sensory impairments, or who may require more time to review and engage with the material, are able to understand and take part.\n\nIf this is not possible, please address the reasons why in the opening address of the event and make alternative arrangements.\nFor example, if the information is sensitive and unable to be shared due to Intellectual Property or Privacy reasons.\n\nFinally, if your event is a workshop that requires live input from attendees, ensure that questionnaires or any reference material that will be discussed are sent out at least two days prior to the start of the event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-comms-presentation-material","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE

but were not sent out before the event, consider sending it as soon as possible.\nFor example, during the event which can support people without internet access, or as soon as possible at the conclusion of the event.\nYou can also send out notes or session minutes taken during the event.\n\nTaking collaborative “live” notes can be very divisive based on different audiences.\nHaving a designated notetaker and being able to read and listen can be beneficial to many people who are encountering new material for the first time, or who may be listening to a presentation that is delivered in a different language.\n\nHowever, being able to engage in an event’s content and simultaneously read notes often requires attendees to have access to a secondary screen or device that can be used for typing, reading, and to view both written and presented material.\nMany members of the public may not have multiple screens set up in their homes, and they may be attending online events on their phones.\n\nEnsure that if you offer live notetaking at your event that your attendees are able to access both the session content and the notes, and that technology you use is one that your attendees are comfortable using and getting access to. Some examples include:\n\nHackMD provides collaborative editing that can be read by screen readers, but these people won’t be able to contribute to editing the document.\n\nGoogle Docs have some accessibility features but screen reader access to editing depends on the user’s operating system.\n\nEtherpad offers full support for screen-readers, and cannot host images or hyperlinks\nAdditional guidance on tools for taking collaborative notes can be found in \n\nTools for Collaboration.\n\nThis is an example of how important it is to involve people with lived experience in your event planning.\nBy having representatives or by getting feedback from your specific community, you will be able to identify the best way to share notes and other materials with your audience.\nIt is preferable to ask more than one advisor, as the solutions used by individuals, as well as their level of experience with technology, can vary significantly.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-comms-event-content","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE

can be minimized.\nFor example, researchers, clinicians and people with a lived experience of arthritis may be more familiar with terms and medication names related to arthritis and associated conditions.\nHowever, many attendees may be unfamiliar with these terms can can feel excluded from conversation and event content that uses them.\n\nAs part of planning, consider how you can reduce the use of jargon and acronyms at your event, and create a strategy for encouraging speakers and facilitators to also avoid unnecessary jargon.\n\nYou may want to develop a Glossary of Terms that can be included in information booklets, and where possible, work with researchers to be mindful of, and review, language choices to ensure inclusivity, such as avoiding gender-specific terms and including language that recognizes the diverse identities engaged in your event.\n\nYou can find online examples of Glossaries developed by research funding bodies, or review the \n\nNHS list of jargon and acronyms for inspiration.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-comms-jargon","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for

reading” format.\n\nPlain Language, sometimes referred to as Plain English in the UK and North America, allows for communications and other information to be read and understood easier.\nConsider how you will encourage attendees and speakers to adopt clear and plain language communication throughout your event.\n\nFor example, you could address and encourage the use of Plain Language during the opening address or by signposting it in your event’s shared information.\nYou could also consider an activity where researchers are paired with non-researchers and are asked to explain their research in under 3 minutes.\nThis can help to bring “clear and effective communication” to the forefront of attendee’s minds and set all attendees up to communicate clearly throughout the event.\n\nUsing Plain Language is especially important in your registration and event information packs.\n\nIf possible, consider co-developing Plain Language and Easy Read content alongside community representatives or person with lived experience.\nIf this is not possible for your event, you can review guidance on how to write in Plain Language and ensure that core communications and event content are checked by using an external tool.\n\nNote\n\nThe Office for National Statistics in the UK has \n\npublished a short guide on writing with Plain Language.\n\nThere are also tools such as the \n\nHemingway App (an online tool that gives you feedback on the clarity of your writing), or Microsoft Word’s reading level reviewer (if you have an account, Microsoft has provided \n\ninstructions on how to use it) which provides the reading level of your document’s content.\n\nYou can also paste the URL of a website into a \n\nReadability Checker to check the overall content and layout of your event’s webpage.\n\nAim to have all core event communications be understandable by a general audience, and written in Plain Language.\nThis does not need to mean that your entire event is pitched to a general audience. However, by making all general information understandable you will be more inclusive and more able to engage all potential attendees, from research staff, researchers, organizers, people with lived experience, and other professions associated with your event’s content.\n\nUsing Plain Language for your communications can help all attendees understand and engage in your event.\n\nAdditionally, consider how you will be mindful of, and review, language choices to ensure inclusivity.\nFor example, avoid gender-specific terms and include language that recognizes diverse identities in your event information and content.\nThis can help acknowledge and respect the cultural differences of your attendees.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-comms#cl-ppie-events-comms-plain-language","position":27},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning Communications for PPIE

computer.\nRelying solely on email communication would cause these attendees to miss out on core communications if they have joined the event on the hosting platform.\nSimilarly, for in-person events, people may not own a portable smart device capable of checking emails or online content.\n\nThere are many different reasons for needing to communicate on the day of the event.\nFor example to make attendants aware if there will be loud noises, content that may trigger photosensitive epilepsy, or to update attendees when your event sessions start after a break.\n\nIt is especially important to consider how you will communicate when there will be sensitive or potentially harmful content being shared.\n“Harmful” can mean a range of things depending on the context.\nFor example, “harmful” content could refer to flickering lights or material that would trigger photosensitive epilepsy, a response to discussion topics that may arise, or a video that could be difficult or uncomfortable for attendees with sensory processing differences to experience.\nConsider communicating an overview of a session’s content before it begins to allow attendees to prepare or choose to leave the session.\n\nConsider what channels your attendees with lived experience receive information from and try to match those in your event communications.\nFor example, some attendees may need to be called on the phone to receive information, or they may require a text instead of an email.\n\nIn many cases, you may need to develop a strategy for how to ensure that all attendees are able to receive event

Similarly, a small room with limited ventilation may not be suited for long sessions with a large number of attendees.\nThese considerations will benefit all events, however may be more important to consider for events that are intended for people with lived experience.\nIt is important to ensure that a space can support the involvement of all its attendees.\nThis can be considering how to lay out tables (circular is best) so that all those seated are able to listen and contribute equally to the discussion, ensuring that there is enough seating for attendees, and can also be considering how the space itself will be laid out to ensure ease of movement and also sufficient places to sit and rest.\n\nCheck with a venue’s child policy before booking and ensure that there are suitable arrangements made if a venue area does not allow children to be present.\nFor example, some museums and botanical garden greenhouses do not allow children to be present for private events. This may mean that attendees with child-caring responsibilities are unable to attend and engage with your event.\n\nDepending on the size of your venue, you may consider if there is space available to use as a multi-faith prayer room or a quiet room that reserves a space away from the event to relax, take medicine privately, and take a sensory break for those who need it.\nThese spaces can help make an event more inclusive and enjoyable for your attendees.\n\nFinally, consider if your venue is hosted in a space that is “dual purpose”.\nFor example, a University Hall may also be used for lectures or by students as a thoroughfare to get to class.\nIf there will be people other than attendees using the space, identify how will you differentiate between staff, attendees, and others who are present in the space.\nYou could use name badges or have staff and organizers in a shared uniform which could help to avoid confusion of an attendee asking a bystander for event assistance.\nPlease also be mindful of how your event will use the spaces provided, for example, if your poster presentation space will also be used to serve food in, try to ensure that food smells are dissipated and plates cleared to support attendees engaging in the session.\n\nIf your event will be attended by people with disabilities, it is important to consider both the Universal Design suggestions made here, and also to ensure that access requirements are sufficiently met.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-location#cl-ppie-events-choosing-venue","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Location","lvl2":"Venue Planning"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-location#cl-ppie-events-location-venue","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Location","lvl2":"Venue Planning"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-location#cl-ppie-events-location-venue","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Location","lvl3":"Signs and Navigation","lvl2":"Venue Planning"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-location#cl-ppie-events-location-signs","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Location","lvl3":"Signs and Navigation","lvl2":"Venue Planning"},"content":"Consider how you will direct and guide people at the venue.

Signs should be clearly visible and identifiable to your attendees.\nTry to place signs and information before and at junctions so that people do not take a wrong turn down a corridor, and if there are locations at your venue that may be difficult to navigate, consider having staff visible to help direct attendees. Use directional arrows, and have signs distributed regularly along paths.\n\nAlthough they may help some individuals, remember that signs and visual information may not be accessible to all attendees and consider how to provide clear guidance at the venue to attendees with visual impairments.\nWhen assisting a disabled person, ask them how you can do this because it varies between individuals.\nDo not touch, grab, or move people with disabilities, their mobility aids, or service dogs without permission.\n\nIt is also important to be cognizant that attendees who are more familiar with the layout

What to focus on"},"content":"When designing and organising an event, it can be easy to focus on accessibility requirements at the venue, and overlook the steps needed to make an event inclusive and enjoyable for all participants.\n\nWe can think of this in terms of “Universal Design” which is about designing an event or environment so that it can be accessed, understood, and used by all people regardless of their background, age, size, ability, or disability.\nThis is different from “Accessible Design” which focuses on designing around specific accessibility requirements.\n\nAn example of Universal Design is the “\n\nCurb Cut effect” which is where curbs on sidewalks and paths are sloped down to meet the main pavement.\nCutting the curb and adding a slope was originally suggested to allow wheelchair access to the street without having to step down from a high curb.\nThis change also benefits most other pedestrians, as well as people who use prams, cyclists, people with mobility aids, and young people meaning that adding curb cuts made walkways and street crossings easier to use for everyone.\nYou can read more about Universal Design on the \n\nUniversal Design Website, however, you do not need to be an expert in design to organize an inclusive and accessible event.\n\nA core feature of PPIE is that members of the public and other non-researchers are actively involved in the research, and this will also be true for your events. When thinking about how to be inclusive of people with lived experience at your event, ensure that you plan beyond just the accessibility requirements that focus on disabilities.\nUsing Universal Design to plan your event allows you to take into account what changes can be made to make your event accessible to a wider audience.\nFor example, recording your sessions and using closed caption software can remove barriers for people with disabilities, and will also benefit a much wider audience.\nSimilarly, improving the signposting will benefit both members of the public who are new to research events, but also early career researchers that have less experience in attending events.\n\nThis chapter and the examples used in it focus heavily on aspects that are relevant when organising events in which members of the public are expected to attend, based on a universal design framework and an understanding of how the considerations benefit a wide audience as well as members of the public who may be attending your event as people with lived experience.\n\nThis chapter is not designed to replace general recommendations and guidelines for running accessible events for people with disabilities, as those will apply to your event planning regardless of whether members of the public are attending them or not.\nAt the relevant places, we have linked to the existing “Accessible Events” chapters and recommend referring to these for specific accessibility practices.\n\nIf your attendees have accessibility requirements, please ensure that those are planned for and met, in addition to taking a universal design approach.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-planning#cl-ppie-events-planning-intro","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning

inclusive at the planning stages ensures that people without lived experience are not making decisions for people with lived experience.\nTo prevent this, consider and define how you will actively involve community representatives or people with lived experience in the event planning process.\nThis will help to ensure both a diverse perspective, and help your event uphold the research goals of co-creation and public involvement.\n\nExamples of how you can implement this would be to consider inviting and including representatives and public advisors into the event planning committee, or alternatively consider hosting town halls and feedback forums that can support and make space for a large audience of people with lived experience to share their perspectives and help steer your event towards success.\nYou could also consider hosting some focus group sessions at regular stages to get feedback on your plans.\n\nAt this stage it is important to consider who your event will be inviting and if there will be any promotional or “product demonstration” content at your event.\nFor example, there are ethical and potential consumer regulation considerations if your event hosts sales or promotional teams from medical device or pharmaceutical companies.\nDepending on the country, there may be regulations around direct promotion to consumers or users of a product which will restrict the amount of involvement that members of the public will be able to have at your event.\nSpecific thought should be given for how to include members of the public at events which may showcase regulated products.\nEnsure that you identify what considerations need to be made in order to facilitate appropriate knowledge sharing within an inclusive research space to make the most of our your event while also safeguarding all attendees.\n\nNote\n\nIf you are able to collaborate with members of the community, please consider how you will recognize or reimburse the time and contributions made.\nThis may involve an honorarium for attending planning meetings and for time spent reviewing policies and other documents.\n\nYou could also consider hosting some focus group sessions at regular stages to get feedback on your plans.\n\nWhere possible, the expertise and labour of people with lived experience should be recognized and

people with lived experience can be researchers as well.\n\nNetworking and social components of the event may feel less welcoming to people with lived experience if they do not know anyone before attending.\nResearchers may attend with some of their regular co-workers or know other attendees already beforehand (especially in niche fields).\nThus, they may be more comfortable joining discussions with others at your event, compared to members of the public that are not embedded in such pre-existing social networks.\nTry to consider ways to open discussion between attendees to avoid a social separation between researchers and members of the public.\n\nAdditionally, many signifiers of social class can be learned and acquired by research professionals during their career, such as how to present and speak confidently, familiarity with technology and scientific advances, as well as general comfort navigating university campuses.\nWhen unaddressed, many members of the public with lived experience may feel unwelcome at research-focused events and feel unable to take part due to a perceived difference in experience and power.\nWhere possible, try to surface hidden knowledge such as what to wear, when to ask questions during a talk, and provide tutorials and instruction for all attendees if your event requires the use of a particular technology like Slack or Slido.\n\nThere are many ways to address the power imbalance and it is best to get recommendations from your community to tailor to your event.\nBuilding rapport and respect between attendees will help your event foster meaningful collaboration and knowledge exchanges between researchers and people with lived experience.\n\nDuring the opening session, set an expectation for open and respectful dialogue between all attendees and create spaces where attendees can ask questions, share their perspective, and engage meaningfully in conversations.\nUpholding a respectful dialogue throughout your event may require active facilitation of conversations to include attendees with lived experience having time to speak and to ensure that a respectful dialogue is maintained.\n\nIt can also be useful to allow attendees to self-identify and differentiate by interest rather than by profession.\nFor example by labelling networking tables with a topic, or putting only names and pronouns on name badges instead of including someone’s name, profession, and university affiliation or workplace.\n\nConsider the ethos and values that your event and community holds when planning what research to invite and uplift at your event.\nResearch projects have historically been focused on academic interest and the pursuit of knowledge without considering the goals and needs of communities with lived experience.\nFor example, autistic and deaf people have emphasised that their communities do not prioritize searches for a cure because of the experience, culture, language they have and the validity of their identities.\nInstead their communities advocate for their involvement in research that addresses and improves their lived experience and quality of life.\nBy highlighting research that aligns with the goals and values of your community, your event can contribute to the balancing and awareness of the power dynamic between researchers and public contributors.\n\nDepending on the event length and the resources available, it may be helpful to provide training on effective communication and collaboration to both experts by profession and experts by experience in attendance.\nSupporting the development of scientific communication skills for all attendees can help bridge any gaps in understanding and enable all attendees to engage in discussion on an equal footing.\nTraining sessions could be part of the event promotional schedule if there are several months - and the resources available - before the event.\nAlternatively, training could also be featured in the program as one of the initial event sessions.\n\nEnsure that you organize the event session chairs, moderators, panelists, and presenters to come from a diverse range of people that includes people with lived experience, researchers, and professionals.\n\nThe equal representation of the attendees by the speakers and facilitators allows for different perspectives to be highlighted and can create a space where people with lived experience feel empowered to engage in sessions.\n\nFinally, as organizers, it is important to understand the power and responsibility you have in deciding how inclusive and accessible your event will be.\nIt is important to acknowledge how your choices may impact the experience and inclusion of people with lived experience at your event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-planning#cl-ppie-events-power-dynamics","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning your Event","lvl3":"Timeline and Timing of

Event","lvl3":"Timeline and Timing of Event","lvl2":"Initial Planning"},"content":"After identifying the “why” and “who” for your event, it is important to plan “when” the event will take place, and to develop a timeline for when tasks need to be completed in order to run your event.\n\nOrganizers should aim to avoid scheduling events on national holidays or religious and cultural days to accommodate attendees of various backgrounds, and depending on the scale of the event, you may also want to consider avoiding other days and timings that would make it difficult to attend for your audience.\nFor example, events during school holidays or sessions that overlap with school pick-up and drop-off times may make it difficult for people with school-age children to attend.\n\nYou should work with your specific community to understand what accessibility and inclusion practices would facilitate their contribution.\nMany members of the public and people with lived experience engage in research projects as a volunteer and will find it difficult to get time off from their workplace to attend an event.\nSimilarly, researchers may find it difficult to attend sessions outside of working hours.\n\nAnother schedule-related accessibility practice is providing breaks that are longer and more frequent than those traditionally allocated for during conferences.\n\nAlthough scheduling is difficult for any form of event organizing, please take the time to consider what barriers an event’s timing will have on your ability to be inclusive of people with lived experience.\nRefer to local resources for any specific dates to avoid and review an interfaith events calendar such as this: \n\nhttps://​www​.interfaith​-calendar​.org/.\n\nWhen planning the dates for the event, it is also useful to consider the potential travel times of your attendees.\nIf your event takes place in-person, try to choose a date and start time that takes into account how long your attendees will need to travel.\nFor example, having your event start at 10:30 a.m. allows for inter-city travel the morning of the event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-planning#cl-ppie-events-timeline","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning your Event","lvl4":"Creating a Planning

Timeline","lvl3":"Timeline and Timing of Event","lvl2":"Initial Planning"},"content":"Your planning timeline will vary greatly based on the scale of your event.\nWe have highlighted areas where your timeline should take into account any considerations that would be specifically supportive of people with lived experience.\n\nAlthough it is always necessary to allow for appropriate time to source speakers, people with lived experience may require more notice than is traditionally given in order to support their attendance and speak at an event.\n\nPeople with lived experience may have additional constraints such as medical appointments, caring responsibilities, requirements to plan travel farther in advance, or a job that does not support their participation in research.\nThese attendees will need to know which accessibility practices you will implement before they decide whether or not to attend your event.\nBarriers like lack of captions or inaccessible conference platform technology can exclude people completely, so it is important to have this information available as early as possible, and to ensure that you have planned for enough time to implement them successfully.\n\nTry to identify potential speakers as early as possible and book dates in their diaries that would allow them to make plans that would support their engagement in the event.\n\nWhere possible, arrange a recording of a talk or an alternative session plan that can be used in the event a speaker or facilitator is unable to attend.\nYou can also arrange to have speakers join remotely if it would be more supportive of their engagement.\n\nCase Study\n\nThe AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Conference in April 2023 had a keynote speaker join and give their keynote address remotely in order to best support their involvement.\nPeople with the lived experience of multiple long-term conditions may find travelling to events taxing which can have a negative impact on their energy levels and ability to engage in daily activities.\nBy supporting the speaker to speak remotely, they were able to give an engaging and thoughtful keynote address without the burden of having to travel.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-planning#cl-ppie-events-timeline-planning","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning your

event inclusive for all participants.\nThis is a fund that can be applied to cover additional costs encountered by people with lived experience attending and engaging in your event.\n\nThese additional costs could be:\n\nAdditional accommodation for people who may need to travel to an event the day prior, or stay longer, if attending in-person.\n\nAny travel costs or support for those with caring responsibilities to cover the cost of a support worker, childcare, or allowing their child to travel with them.\n\nHonorarium for members of the public with lived experience to attend sessions.\nMany members of the public may be volunteering their time or having to take unpaid time off work in order to attend your event.\nRecognizing their contributions can also help to address power imbalances between career researchers and members of the public.\n\nHonorariums for speakers, facilitators, and note-takers if they are needed for your event.\n\nSupport for accessibility practices such as a Sign Language Interpreter.\n\nReimbursements for accessible transport (for example, taxis can often be more expensive than public transport but may be required depending on the location of your event).\n\nProvide funds to cover costs of reliable internet access to remote meetings for people in low-bandwidth environments.\n\nIt is important to create a clear policy for what activities and costs can be covered by an Accessibility Fund.\n\nHonorariums and Reimbursements may have separate policies and timelines, and it is important to be as transparent as possible in order to include people with lived experience engaging in your event.\nIt is advisable to highlight who is responsible for payments, how any reimbursement procedures will work and their expected timeline, and provide clear guidance on what expenses will be covered.\n\nIt is also very important to understand how honorarium may affect an individuals’ state benefits.\nFor many countries, receiving an honorarium payment is viewed by government as “income” and could affect future eligibility for benefits.\nAlthough you as an events organizer do not need to become an expert in tax and benefits, it is critical to communicate and be flexible about how compensation is provided.\nFor the UK, the Social Care Institute for Excellence has collated a \n\nuseful overview  on supporting people with lived experience at your event who may be on benefits.\n\nAdditionally, UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Research has published \n\nGuidance on Payment for researchers who need to cost public involvement activities at any stage of the research process that can be used as a reference for developing your event’s honorarium policy.\n\nPlease ensure that all documentation and communication about honorarium and reimbursements are written in an Easy Read format following \n\nPlain Language guidance and if possible, provide clear pathways on how to submit documents.\nMany members of the public may not have a printer in their homes and may share a computer or smartphone to take part in events.\n\nWhere possible, please be mindful of the technology and process barriers that people may face and make processes as clear as possible.\nReview your organization’s honorarium policy, and consider what steps will be needed to align your policy with what is both recommended and what is required.\n\nCase Study\n\nCommunity events run by the Multiple Long Term Conditions Community of Practice are often attended by people with blindness and low vision.\nThese community members receive an honorarium for their participation in focus group sessions and requested a support person to type and guide them through the reimbursement forms.\nWhile this example was specific to the needs of that community and may not be a requirement for all types of events, it highlights the additional considerations such as the budget, communication, and the data protection/privacy requirements in order for that would be needed for a member of staff to support attendees with completing the forms.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-planning#cl-ppie-events-planning-honorarium","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Planning your

up a dedicated email address that is active before and during the event for people to direct accessibility questions towards.\nFor example, during the event an attendee with low vision can email and ask for context on content that was shared during a live session.\n\nLarge-scale conferences may also consider dedicating a member of staff for each day of the conference who is fully informed onthe

design of your event, and making plans for how to accommodate the diverse needs of your attendees, are critical steps in developing a schedule or agenda for your event to facilitate the inclusion of people with lived experience.\n\nThis can involve considerations ranging from planning sufficient breaks between sessions to developing an action plan for inclusion and accessibility practices so people with lived experience can contribute and benefit from your event’s activities.\n\nThis section provides guidance and recommendations for how to plan an inclusive and accessible event schedule (or agenda) and highlights what steps you can take to create a welcoming atmosphere where attendees with lived experience are heard and valued, and are able to equitably engage in your event.\n\nIt is crucial in your planning to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility in your event’s scheduling and programming, and to recognize that many of the traditional approaches to schedules and agendas may create barriers or be inaccessible for people with lived experience or disabilities.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-schedules","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Creating Schedules and Agendas for Inclusive Events","lvl2":"Event Design:

Events","lvl3":"Start and End Times","lvl2":"Event Design: Timing and Event Duration"},"content":"To accommodate travellers, consider starting your event later in the day and finishing mid-afternoon.\nThis can help attendees who may not be comfortable travelling at peak times or have care/family responsibilities.\nIf your event needs to start early in the morning, consider hosting a welcome session that is not critical to attend.\n\nOrganizers should aim to avoid scheduling events on national holidays or religious and cultural days to accommodate attendees of various backgrounds, and depending on the scale of the event, you may also want to consider avoiding other days and timings that would make it difficult to attend for your audience.\nFor example, events during school holidays or sessions that overlap with school pick-up and drop-off times may make it difficult for people with school-age children to attend.\nYou can view an interfaith events calendar here: \n\nhttps://​www​.interfaith​-calendar​.org/.\n\nFor many members of the public, meeting outside working hours can be easier due to otherwise conflicting schedules as they may be engaging in research projects as a volunteer and would find it difficult to get time off from their workplace to attend an event.\nFor others however, such as those with caring responsibilities, the opposite is true.\nYou should seek to work with your specific community to understand what their needs may be, and find a time that works for them.\n\nWhen planning the dates for the event, it is also useful to consider the potential travel times of your attendees.\nIf your event takes place in-person, try to choose a date and start time that takes into account how long your attendees will need to travel.\nFor example, having your event start at 10:30 a.m. allows for inter-city travel the morning before the event.\n\nEvents that occur on weekends or during working hours can negatively impact the ability of people with lived experience who have jobs or caregiving commitments to attend events.\nBy considering when your attendees will be required elsewhere, you will be more likely to find a time that suits everyone.\n\nAlthough scheduling is difficult for any form of event organizing, please take the time to consider what barriers an event’s timing will have on your ability to be inclusive of people with lived experience and refer to your local area for any specific dates to avoid.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-schedules#cl-ppie-events-start-times","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Creating Schedules and Agendas for Inclusive

Events","lvl3":"Session Duration","lvl2":"Event Design: Timing and Event Duration"},"content":"Your schedule should take into account breaks and meal times, and carefully plan the length of its sessions.\n\nIf your event takes place in person, make sure to allow for sufficient time for people with lived experiences and/or disabilities that affect mobility to move between locations.\nFor example, consider how long it would take to get to an accessible elevator and then travel between floors, or how far away accessible restrooms are.\nIf your main room has only one exit and a large audience, it may take significantly longer to exit the room and cause attendees stress as they have to rush between sessions.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, try to plan for the most important parts of your event’s content to be shared within blocks of time that are under 40 minutes.\n\nBecause many events are planned in 1-hour or 1.5-hour timing blocks, consider choosing shorter sessions or incorporating breaks within your session.\nThis can be done in addition to allocating 5-10 minutes for an introduction and session set-up.\nBreaks and shorter session lengths will help reduce the cognitive strain affecting many people with lived experience of cognitive disabilities.\n\nExample 1: 1-hour Focus Group Event\n- 10 minute welcome, Code of Conduct, and session introduction\n- 40 minute Discussion between participants\n- 10 minute break or 10 minute thank you and session close\n\nExample 2: 1-hour Workshop Event\n- 5 minute introduction\n- 20 minute session\n- 5 minute break\n- 20 minute session\n- 10 minute break or 10 minute thank you and session close\n\nIt is best to get feedback and input from representatives with lived experience when planning your session timings.\n\nTry to get feedback on plans for your event as early as possible and ensure that you work with the community or a representative with lived experience when deciding on the format and duration of your specific event.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-schedules#cl-ppie-events-session-duration","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Creating Schedules and

support the involvement and engagement of people with lived experience who are attending for the purposes of sharing their lived expertise.\n\nIf you are organizing a multi-day conference, consider picking either a single day or a repeating timeslot that features any content specifically important for people with lived experience.\nFor example, Day 1 of a 3-Day event might schedule the majority of sessions focused on public engagement and lived experience, followed by Day 2 which could focus on technical workshops and other content.\nAlternatively, if your conference is online, consider choosing a repeating session time from 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. on all 3 days that could focus on lived experience content.\n\nThis can support the engagement and contributions of people with lived experience who volunteer their time to engage in research, as well as people with a lived experience that significantly impacts their energy levels.\n\nWhen deciding where in your schedule to plan content discussing PPIE, ensure that you work with, or ask people with lived experience from your specific audience what would work for them, instead of assuming and choosing times that are otherwise empty in

your event.\nFor example, a public lecture may ask attendees to submit questions for the speaker at the end of the lecture.\nFor this example, indicate in your guidance how much time will be used for questions, how to use any online software you may be using to collect audience questions, and also how many questions you are likely going to answer.\nThis can help avoid any feeling attendees may have about being ignored or not heard if their question is not addressed.\nEnsure that the moderator is taking questions from a diverse subset of the audience.\n\nFor other events that require active participation, such as a focus group or discussions, consider including guidance on the format discussions will have, and if there are any specific topics or prior material attendees should be familiar with in order to take part.\nDetermine if your event will facilitate discussion between attendees, or if the sessions are to be chaired and led by a facilitator.\nCommunicating to attendees that participation is expected, and what the specific format of participation will be, can help alleviate worry or anxiety that attendees may have, and also set the session up for

group(s) can be facilitated by a note taker, and the “Writing” group(s) can work together in collaborative documents.\nYou may also consider recording your event’s content and making documents

sessions that allow for multiple channels of engagement and accessibility practices (such as electronic and in-person communication) in order to be as inclusive of as many people as possible.\nBecause all events are limited by the resources available to plan and host the event, it is important to provide clear guidance on what engagement means for your event and to work with representatives with lived experience to identify what methods of engagement your event will need to support.\n\nEnsure that you provide an outline of your guidance in both a written format before the event, and also

reflexively evaluate whether their participation aligns with those goals.\n\nAdditionally, consider if your goals are measurable so that you can more easily conclude after the event whether the goals were reached.\n\nSharing an event’s goals can foster a sense of trust among attendees by presenting how the perspectives and contributions of people with lived experience are valued by the research project team.\nThis can be especially important for “data-driven” research that otherwise places a large focus on algorithmic techniques and may make lived experience contributors feel unwelcome and excluded from the project.\n\nInclusive research requires not only active participation from people with lived experience and diverse backgrounds, but also actively ensuring that their opinions and

people with lived experience, you should consider designing your event’s sessions to allow for experts through experience to engage in the material equitably alongside any attendees who are experts by profession, instead of being segregated out for being “non-researchers”.\n\nNote\n\nMozilla has developed a framework called \n\nADIDS that can help event organizers plan sessions that actively engage and involve a diverse audience.\nYou can read more about ADIDS on the \n\nMozFest website, or by working through the framework for your own

moderators at your event, consider how they can actively promote the engagement of - and contributions from - people with lived experience.\nThis is especially important for events that focus on discussion or require active participation (such as the World Cafes we discussed in the previous section).\nMany people with lived experience may not have a lot of experience, or had the opportunity

and delivery of events ensures the perspective  of people with lived experience is built into the dialogue throughout your event.\nActive involvement could be including people with lived experience in the planning committee of your event, and asking potential attendees for feedback on the planning and materials of your event.\nYou should aim to have community members or a representative involved in all aspects of planning.\nFor larger events that are not solely focused on PPIE, consider establishing roles and responsibilities for PPIE contributors on planning commitees that are not solely limited to tasks related to their own participation or the event’s PPIE activities.\n\nActive involvement can also help organizers develop a greater understanding of what is important from the perspective of people with lived experience and ensure that the proposed structure and content of the event is shaped in a way that will meet the needs of the potential attendees.\n\nTheir involvement can offer insight and perspective into the specific challenges and needs of individuals with disabilities and any specific lived experience your event is focused on, and also help identify research to

genuinely accessible, respectful, and responsive to all participants.\nConsider if you are able to both involve representatives in your planning committees, and also get feedback from a wider community.\nThis is because a single representative may not be familiar with all the requirements and needs from your attendees, which in many cases may be very diverse.\nAsking for feedback from other participants remains key.\n\nThe two options discussed above are ideal, as people with lived experience will be able to provide insights and perspectives on how to encourage and support the

range of attendees, and plan for content that is interesting and accessible to your attendees.\n\nAt larger events, it may not be possible to develop a full schedule with sessions inclusive and ready

This may also have the added benefit of improving the research conducted by attendees, or influence project design in the future.\n\nIncluding and highlighting speakers or session leads with lived experience and offering a diverse range of perspectives both broadens the scope of representation, and can prevent assumptions and stereotypes about people with lived experience.\nThis can then act to further empower other attendees with lived experience to become more actively involved in your event and research as a whole.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-schedules#cl-ppie-events-schedule-diverse-speakers","position":31},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Creating Schedules and Agendas for Inclusive Events","lvl3":"Providing Event Descriptions","lvl2":"Creating an Inclusive Program"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/collaboration/ppie-events/ppie-events-schedules#cl-ppie-events-event-descriptions","position":32},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Creating Schedules and Agendas for Inclusive Events","lvl3":"Providing Event Descriptions","lvl2":"Creating an Inclusive Program"},"content":"Consider including a description of your intended audience and any expertise requirements in your session information.\nEnsure that these session descriptions, the program, and any organisational information are written using \n\nPlain Language that is able to be understood by your audience.\n\nInclude session descriptions in the program of events.

networking sessions often take place at the end of the day which can lead to the exclusion of many attendees such as those with caring responsibilities, and many others who experience fatigue after a full day of active engagement.\n\nConsider hosting a social breakfast or networking session before lunch for all attendees.\nThis can provide an opportunity for people to meet one another and join discussions before the formal start of your event.\n\nAdditionally, for events taking place in person, consider hosting in-person networking events before a sit-down lunch or meal. This will both help people with anxiety who may feel uncomfortable and unsure of where to sit and eat lunch, and can also act as an ice breaker to facilitate conversation between researchers and attendees with lived experience.\nHosting a social session before sit-down meals can help these attendees connect with other people and identify who to sit with during the

DOI: \n\nThe Turing Way Community & Scriberia (2024).\n\nRemote collaboration is quite a standard practice in open source projects or online communities.\nIt has gained popularity over the last few years as more and more companies expand their businesses in areas far from the location of the main office (for example, \n\nMozilla), or exist entirely as a remote company (for example, \n\nRStudio).\n\nIn early 2020, as we began to work entirely from home due to the \n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we experienced a drastic change in our work culture.\nSince 2022, these changes have permanently become part of our work culture, with most people working remotely either fully or partially, with a requirement to go to physical offices for a few days per week or month, or only when necessary.\nThis chapter will present resources and tips for researchers to make their transition of working from the office (physical location) to working from home (online/virtual) easier, or make their collaboration more effective if they are already working remotely.- Add a summary of all the subchapters

always work for everyone, which applies to remote collaboration, working, and event participation.\nFor many, remote collaboration is the most ideal setting, whereas for many, working completely online might leave them feeling isolated.\nSome people collaborate more effectively when working in physical offices, for example, when they live in a small apartment, share their place with a large family, have an inadequate remote-work setting or feel less connected with their colleagues.\nHowever, for others, remote working may be the most effective way to contribute, when working with online tools, or directly working on platform that do not require speaking up.\nTherefore, it is important to acknowledge that remote collaboration have advantages as well as disadvantages, and the collaboration formats should accommodate for, or designed to address challenges that come with it.\n\nIn The Turing Way we recognise ‘virtual first’ approach for creating inclusive collaboration formats.\nIt is easier to work with people online who live in different locations (cities, countries) and can’t travel, folks who are introverted or don’t like to or can’t speak publicly, people with caring responsibilities at home or people who have visible or invisible disability to work comfortably in person.\n\n“As someone who used to commute 4 hours per day for 12 years, I can sum my experiences in four words - remote working reduces inequality”, says one of our contributors, Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez (GitHub: PabRod).\n\nIn this subchapter, we have captured light opinions a few

dramatically improves the life quality of those who cannot comfortably travel or afford to live close to their office.\n\nIt has a positive impact on the environment by reducing travel-related CO2

expense.\n\nDistributed team format attracts people from different time zones, different workplace requirements or those who work best with flexible working hour arrangements.\n\nThis can lead to innovative ways to establish social interactions and social dynamics in general.\n\nIt will help us learn about more colleagues from different parts of the world and educate us more about our cultural

background involved lab work and method development, experiences which allows me to speak the same language as the researchers of the Faculty of Applied Sciences.\nWhile I don’t use the same

the Research Data Management policy of the Faculty (based on the TU Delft policy).\nTogether with the Data Steward of another faculty, I reached out to every department to gather feedback on the policy.\nThis process took almost a year, but ensured that the awareness of the policy increased and more importantly: the policy is practically relevant and provides guidelines that researchers appreciated.\n\nFrom data, the role moved to include software support.\nI attended a Carpentry Workshop (beginner workshop to learn basic programming skills) in 2019 and later that year I became a certified trainer.\nWhile I do not use programming for my daily work necessarily (I use it for parts of it to analyse data or generate reports, or provide data visualisations for my own research), these basic training sessions make it easier to understand requirements regarding software and code management and sharing.\nAt a technical university this is quite crucial, as most of the researchers at the faculty use programming languages on a daily basis.\nIt also allowed me to co-organise a \n\ngenetic data workshop together with researchers from my faculty for their department.\n\nSince 2020, I’m also increasingly focusing on general Open Science support.\nThis was something that was already a part of the role from the very start, but now I’m actively promoted as the contact person for Open Science support at the Faculty level.\nThere is additional support for Open Science at the Library, in particular the \n\nOpen Science Programme at the TU

experience with advising and policy construction.\nSoft skills are important in the advisory/policy roles, as you need to..\n\nThe “Towards FAIR data stewardship as profession” report (\n\nScholtens et al., 2019) concluded that there are eight competency areas that of importance to Data Stewards:\n\nPolicy/strategy: designing or raising awareness of research data management policies and regulations\n\nCompliance: advise on how to confer to research data management policies and regulations\n\nFacilitating FAIR/recommended research data management practices\n\nServices: propose, implement and monitor data management services and improve work processes\n\nData infrastructure: identify requirements for infrastructure and tools\n\nKnowledge management: identify the level of research data management knowledge and skills\n\nNetwork and communication: set up networks to increase awareness and participate in (inter)national research data management networks\n\nData sharing: archiving and publishing\n\nNext to these specific areas coordination of work and development of soft skills may be important.\nSee also: \n\nJetten et al., 2021\n\nGenerally, Data Stewards acquire these skills through learning-on-the-job, which is facilitated by existing networks (see \n\nOrganisations that support Data Stewards below).\nThrough these networks experiences can be exchanged with peers, which is beneficial for personal and professional development.\nAn examples of these collaborative efforts is the ‘23 Things: Support for Research Data’(\n\nJetten et al., 2019) that provides a good overview of helpful resources for Data Stewards.\nDepending on the role of the Data Steward, learning discipline specific skills may be important through contributing to specific projects or

At this time, this role was new at the Turing and I could not actually be called a RCM so my job title was Research Associate.\n\nBefore I joined the Turing, I did quite a few different types of roles in and out of academia and I think this varied experience, and the skills I learnt along the way, make me ideal for the varied and broad work of a RCM.\nI started my academic career as an Archaeobotanists (an archaeologists that specialises in plant remains) with a PhD from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London.\nIn my PhD, I did a replication study of someone elses identification method, and quiet unsurprisingly!, I found it could not be replicated accurately.\nThis sparked my interest in reproducibility and open research.\nAfter finishing my PhD, I went off to work in Education and trained as a high school science teacher and worked in various education roles for about 10 years.\nI then started to come back into academia and focus on open research.\nI’ve led community open research projects, such as the FAIR Phytoliths Project at Historic England, and I lead a community called \n\nOpen Phytoliths that is striving to bring open research practices into this discipline (phytolith research) and also more widely in related disciplines such as Archaeology and Palaeoecology.\nI also work with other open research communities such as OLS, Software Sustainability Institute and ELIXIR.\n\nSince working at the Turing, I have worked across different health data science projects and with interest groups and I also work closely with the Turing Skills Team on data science skills related research and community projects.\n\nI very much see myself now as a generalist with lots of transferable skills that can be applied in any research domain and I really enjoy the challenge of working in multiple disciplines.","type":"content","url":"/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/research-community-manager-personal-story-1#introduction-tell-us-about-your-background-and-how-you-became-a-rcm","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Research Community Manager Personal Story","lvl2":"Embedding RCM at Turing"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/research-community-manager-personal-story-1#embedding-rcm-at-turing","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Research Community Manager Personal Story","lvl2":"Embedding RCM at Turing"},"content":"At Turing, I joined the Institute when there was only one other RCM -

DOI \n\nThe Turing Way Community & Scriberia (2024)).\n\nTell us about your background, and what led you to set up the RSE Asia Association?\n\nMy name is \n\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal and I’m a Statistician based in India.\nI am interested to learn about open source and open science and like to remain involved with open science community work.\nIn early 2021, I wrote the first draft of the \n\nR Development Guide through a project funded by the \n\nR Foundation. Furthermore, I co-lead the work on the outreach of the R Development Guide at the \n\nDigital Infrastructure Incubator at Code for Science & Society.\nRecently, I am working as a Technical Writer with The R Project at the Google Season of Docs 2022 for a project to \n\n“Expand and Reorganize the R Development Guide”.\nPreviously, I have also worked with the Julia Language organization for \n\nGoogle Summer of Code 2020.\nIn early 2022, I was selected as the founding committee of NumFOCUS Project Incubator.\nThis Incubator is designed to support the growth of open-source scientific projects and communities and provide such projects with the required tools for becoming NumFOCUS Affiliated.\nI co-founded the \n\nResearch Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association during my participation in the \n\nCohort 4 of the Open Life Science programme, to promote the RSE community and profession in the Asia region.\nI am also participating in the \n\nPilot Mentorship Programme of the Society of Research Software Engineering to further build the RSE Asia community.\n\nWhat is the main motivation behind starting the RSE Asia Association?\n\nThe RSE Asia Association was started because there was a lack of representation from the Asian region in the international RSE community. Another reason was the significant timezone difference with the global north.\nDespite the shift of events to online mode due to the pandemic, the timezone difference remains a challenge for us when attending the events.\nHence, we started RSE Asia to conduct events in a more Asia friendly timezone, and promote the RSE community and profession in Asia.\n\nHow did you get started?\n\nAlong with \n\nJyoti Bhogal, I started by getting a structured mentorship for building RSE Asia.\nThe \n\nOpen Life Science programme’s Cohort-4 (OLS-4) is where we started scoping out our work and built initial social presence as well as public infrastructure like our \n\nwebsite and \n\nTwitter account.\nWe launched RSE Asia on 14th October 2021 during our participation in OLS-4.\nThe launch invitation and our graduation video from OLS-4 are available on our \n\nwebsite.\n\nWhat impact do you think is the RSE Asia Association is making in your community?\n\nWithin less than a year from our launch, we already have followers from around the work on our official \n\nTwitter account.\nI now represent RSE Asia as an observer at the \n\ninternational council of RSE.\nI was also invited to various RSE events taking place at the international levels, including direct mentorship and support from the Society of RSE.\nBased on these interactions and connections, it has become evident that representation from Asian communities had been long missing in the international RSE networks and RSE Asia Association is committed to address that.\nThus, the impact I see is that RSE Asia is gaining momentum & receiving recognition in the international RSE community.\n\nWhat tools/software do you use most for the RSE Asia Association digital infrastructure?\n\nMostly \n\nGitHub organization, our \n\norganization website is hosted on GitHub.\n\nDo you have any top tips for other people that might be interested in starting a Research Software Engineering association/community?\n\nIf possible try to start with a structured mentoring programme, like the \n\nOpen Life Science Programme - they can be immensely helpful in your community-building journey as they empower you with the best of tools and advice from the very start.\n\nDo you have any tips on things to avoid?\n\nTry to collaborate more and avoid working solo when you start with community building, it can get too big, too soon - so it is always helpful to have a group of collaborators along.\n\nAre there any other organisations/networks that you’re collaborating with?\n\nI (with my Co-Founder \n\nJyoti) started building the RSE Asia Association as a project during my participation in the \n\nOpen Life Science Cohort-4 (OLS-4) programme with \n\nAnne Fouilloux as our mentor.\nAfter OLS-4, I participated in the \n\nPilot Mentoring Programme by the Society of Research Software Engineering to further build the community around RSE Asia under the mentorship of \n\nMichelle Barker, whereas Jyoti joined \n\nOLS-5 with a project to create onboardings pathways under the mentorship of Malvika Sharan.\nRecently, I presented talks about the work being done at RSE Asia at various events organized by groups and networks like the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN53), the Research Software Alliance, the Collaborations Workshop (CW22) by the Software Sustainability Institute (All these talks are shared on our \n\nwebsite.).\nWe are open to collaborating with other organisations and networks too!\n\nApart from timezone differences what would you describe as the main challenge for your community?\n\nIt is a multinational association - so that is a unique challenge in itself.\nSeveral languages and cultures thrive in Asia and we are planning to set up a working group that includes representatives from different parts and nationalities of Asia - so that we have more understanding of the local research culture.\n\nWhat problems did you encounter along the way and what were some of the ways to solve them?\n\nLack of awareness about the term ‘Research Software Engineering’ in Asia has been challenging.\nTo solve this we are planning to conduct some awareness events (more on that will be available on our website soon).\n\nWhat types of activities does RSE Asia support? Are there other activities you’d like to support in the future?\n\nWe participated in Hacktoberfest 2021.\nWe are very keen on participating in online events/workshops/hackathons that help provide exposure to technical skills to our community members and also highlight the work that they do!\nIn the future, we hope to co-organize some events with the Open Science communities and the international RSE community.\n\nWhich other organisations have influenced you the most when starting up RSE Asia?\n\nThe \n\nSociety of Research Software Engineering has been the most influential one.\nI got introduced to the work of the Society during my participation in the \n\nuseR! 2021 conference.\n\nHave you planned/do you foresee any governance structure for RSE Asia Association?\n\nWe are planning to set up a working group for RSE Asia soon.\nSetting up an Advisory Board is the next step toward bringing more structure to the organisation’s governance process.\n\nHave you been able to connect with other RSE associations across the globe? Has this been useful? How can other RSE associations help you get started?\n\nYes, we are planning to collaborate with RSE AUNZ for an event happening this year.\nI feel it is very useful to connect with the other RSE associations as there is always an exchange of ideas.\nBesides that, I am an observer at the international council of RSEs and represent RSE Asia there.\nAt the council meetings, I get to interact with the representatives from various RSE associations and know more about their work.\nWe are always open to discussing collaborations with the other RSE associations.\n\nAbout awareness raising -- there is a similar issue in Latin America; to the best of my knowledge, the discussion around the need for RSEs hasn’t even started there yet! Is starting the RSE community a one-person effort? Or is there a critical mass of people pushing this effort?\n\nTo start with we are only a couple of people leading this initiative in Asia.\nAlthough we have immensely benefited from various Mentorship programmes and Mentors, there is still a need to get more people involved from Asia to push the effort forward.\nWith the hope to achieve this, we are planning to set up a working group soon.\n\nWhere do you see the RSE Asia Association going in the future?\n\nI feel the RSE Asia Association would expand more and include more representatives across the Asian region in the future.\nWe are setting up a Working Group and an Advisory Board for RSE Asia, details for which are shared on the \n\nRSE Asia Association.\n\nThis personal story in the form of an open interview was originally written by Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal during the Turing Way book Dash in May 2022.

essentially assigns ownership of the project to a few individuals: although the source code may be freely available, projects are often not open for collaboration or do not incentivise contribution.\nThis is a two-pronged problem - in the immediate term it prevents the building up of effective user and developer communities who could help to improve the software and in the long term, it may mean that codes retire along with their owners.\nMany code suites, especially those using High-Performance Computing (HPC), those in long-established fields and legacy code more

established institutions, the process is hampered when working with old projects, or those new projects that arise within ingrained norms of research software.\nResearch software is developed by individuals within research groups, which operate within an organisation or a regulated research environment.\nFor instance, nationally-funded research operates under national laws that may not always comply with the legal requirements in other countries.\nOrganisations hosting these research themselves are constrained by national laws and international interests.\nThe very structure of these institutions depends on ownership.\nFor example, we have found that arranging collaboration agreements for joint funding is often held up by the need to define ownership of the intellectual property, even if the software is open source.\nThis may be part of the larger legal framework: specifying that software is owned by a project or community rather than a person may be ideal for encouraging participation, but it could also be open to abuse if the legal ownership of the software can be disputed, or worse, appropriated by bad

documentation can be used and shared.\n\nAn open source project is more than just the code and documents associated with the software.\nA major part of a project is about the people involved -- the roles they play, the way they interact with each other, share responsibilities, make contributions and receive recognition.\nNone of those is regulated by the license but is undeniably more important

asks what the team chooses to prioritise, what they value, what motivates them, and ultimately what real-world impact they hope to see from their work.\nA helpful model to inform this exercise is Simon Sinek’s \n\nGolden Circle method, where the team approaches their work in the following order:\n\nWhy: Why are we doing what we’re doing?\n\nThis is the ultimate ‘North Star’ or ‘vision’ of the project - the fundamental, emotive reason the work is being done.\n\nHow: How do we achieve our mission?\n\nThis question concerns the broad focus areas, or ‘pillars’ that set up the project to achieve the vision.\n\nWhat: What do we actually do?\n\nThis question takes the why and the how, and identifies key activities that teams can undertake to achieve their goals.\n\nIt is important to

continuity- schedule all session well ahead of time so that all team members can attend all sessions.\n\nA synthesized output from these sessions, such as a comprehensive, professional slide deck, can

the tool in a real-world scenario.\nBy considering potential users of the tool from the early stages of a project, you can include features that will make the tool easier to use and more relevant to potential stakeholders, and therefore more likely to be used and applied in practice.\n\nExisting resources can also benefit greatly from making improvements to the UX by establishing heuristics to define criteria for usability and to identify areas in need of improvement.\nBy utilising exercises and heuristics designed specifically to consider and evaluate the user experience, researchers will examine the assumptions built into the tool and gain a deeper understanding of how it can serve different users types.\nThese insights can help a team to develop a roadmap for the tool to plan out future developments with varied stakeholders in mind, leading to more meaningful stakeholder engagements based around a deeper understanding of how those stakeholders are interacting with and

Here is a link to our \n\nChapter on acknowledgements.\nWe use an \n\nall contributors bot to record the type of contributions different members make that is shown on our Github Readme file and we also have \n\ncontributor profiles at the end of the book, in which each contributor can record their contributions in more detail.\n\nAlthough The Turing Way is not an academic article, it is a published online book, and therefore we have \n\nauthorship guidelines.\nThe first author is always The Turing Way Community and then authors are listed in alphabetical order by last name.\nAuthorship is cumulative so authors will always remain authors.\nConsequently, this model of authorship gives equal recognition as an author to any contribution and therefore in this sense is an authorship of contributors rather than authors.\n\nThis is similar to a consortia authorship.\nThis is a collective of authors and all members of the consortium are considered authors and must be listed in the published articles as such. Sometimes this is seen in the journal as a large list of authors or can be shown as the community name, however underneath all of the author names of the community will be visible.\n\nAnother recent development in the use of the CRediT taxonomy is the idea of providing a cover page to an article much like seen on film-credits. This recent \n\npre-print by the Living with Machines Project has taken this approach.\nThe authors remark that this model of authorship relies on all authors openly acknowledging the importance of everyone’s contributions.\nThe Living with Machines project is discussed in the \n\npersonal story about authorship in interdisciplinary projects at the end of this chapter.\n\nThe use of ORCID is another way to ensure equitable authorship. ORCID is a persistent digital identifier for researchers.\nIt means that even if a researchers name changes in some way, such as not using exactly the same name on each paper or a change of surname, their publications will still be linked back to them.\nIt guarantees recognition for your contributions.\n\nFind out more information about \n\nORCID in our sub-chapter in the Guide for Communication.","type":"content","url":"/communication/aa/aa-equitable","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Types of authorship misconduct"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/communication/aa/aa-misconduct","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Types of authorship misconduct"},"content":"There are various forms of authorship misconduct.\nThese reflect unequal power structures in academia.\nAuthorship misconduct results in a lack of transparency and accountability in research.\n\nA study of inappropriate authorship in biomedical journals found 21.0% of the article included honorary authorship, ghost authorship or both in 2008.\nThis is a reduction from a study in 1996 (29.2%) but shows that these practices are still prevalent \n\nWislar et al.

What is the normal practice of authorship for academic papers in your discipline? or used to be the normal practice?\n\nRemi: My background is in Biology and Psychology.\nMost papers are multi-author and so have more than one author. Single authorship can happen but not for experimental work.\nThis work usually involves at least a Principal Investigator with a Postdoctoral Researcher or PhD student.\n\nSingle author papers don’t have a bad reputation.\nThey tend to be theoretical, summarizing articles or opinion pieces.\nHowever, they are more unusual now. This is because of a need to collaborate as projects are more complex and therefore require more skills and hence more people.\n\nThere are still some problematic practices happening such as providing materials for the project because of wanting to get on the paper.\nSo yes, these people are providing something that makes the project possible, such as a raw material needed for the project, but are not making a substantial contribution to the project in any other way.\n\nIn terms of the order of authors on papers, usually the two first names are very important and the two last names.\nFirst names are the people who have completed the most work on the project and the last two names have supervisory roles.\nThe middle ranking authors can be random or alphabetical.\n\nThere is a slow move towards using the \n\nCRediT system now; giving a description of what the contributions have been.\nThe issue with this is that it is a very detailed description of the different roles and there is a lot of push back about this and trying to do things differently.\n\nThe increase in large collaborative papers and also the generation of software in projects means authorship needs to be dealt with in a different way.\n\nIsil: I am a mathematician and have a Computer Science MSc, so I have more insights from the engineering practices due to my background, in which the authorship models follow a more compact authorship line-up.\nThis means authorship that mainly constitutes of PhD or Postdoctoral students who actively work in the project as the first authors and the most senior person, such as the supervisors, principal investigators as the last author.\nHowever, with the development of more interdisciplinary research in the field, we have seen an increase in the number of authors that are included in papers.\n\nAs the general rule of thumb, the author lists are created by those who made a ‘significant intellectual contribution’ to scientific research.\nHowever the complication comes from having no clear definition or metrics to quantify the significance of the contribution that has been made.\n\nThe only definition that has been made to this day is by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) as \"Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the concept, design, execution, or interpretation of the research study”, which still does not give a clear guideline regarding how to evaluate the contributors in the fairest and consistent way across journals, institutions and laboratories.\n\n2. When did you discuss authorship in your project?\n\nRemi: This was done very early in the project.\nWe spent some of the first three meetings, in which the two main questions were finding out how to deal with authorship and the journal we wanted to aim for.\nWe also discussed how we were dividing up the tasks.\n\nEven with this early approach, there were some headaches.\nThe main issues were whether authorship should be all alphabetical, random or ranking.\n\nThe order does let people know to what level they want to contribute and has implications on different peoples input into the project.\n\nAlphabetical authorship order would not seem very radical in some groups, such as an open science crowd.\nBut in other settings it is very radical and may mean that some researchers are less keen to contribute if they don’t get the recognition for their work that they think they should get.\n\nIsil: In addition to these, there have been some discussions regarding using consortium authorships with some examples given from previous papers by the community members as in \n\nSciPy paper or as in \n\nOpen Brain Consent.\n\nBut going back to what Remi mentioned, through the discussions, the feeling was that there had been some missing links in the general understanding regarding what the audience of a community paper should be in comparison to a scientific paper.\nHow the authorship model and the expectations regarding the contributions should be justified and what they should be formed like.\n\nTherefore, these consortium authorship models remained a topic that needed more extensive discussions, which was not possible due to the pressure of time.\n\n3. Who had the discussion about authorship in your project?\n\nRemi: Everybody was included in the discussions at the beginning of the project and we had a vote on it.\n\nThese general guidelines were documented but were to be revisited at a later stage of the project.\n\nProblems arose when more people joined the project.\nMost people agreed with the framework and guidelines but I’m not sure that they were made aware of this fully when onboarding.\nIt was a rush and the process was rushed.\n\nLater on there were more discussions about authorship.\n\nThe time scale of the project, and the writing of articles, is going to affect the authorship process.\n\nIt will affect who gets a say and if the decisions are made correctly.\nIf you have to move fast, then having a democratic decision takes a long time in a large community and might not be possible.\nTo speed up the process, we found some core members needed to make decisions, but this undermines the process.\n\nIsil: Also the discussions, the voting to be done, the decisions taken or to be taken were all shared through the public communication channels and a google email list that includes all the contributors to make sure everyone had a chance to see this information or follow the process one way or another.\n\n4. What approach have you decided to take in your project?\n\nRemi: Our guidelines set out that we list authors into three groups:\n\nGroup 1 are a core team of people that are actively working in the project and writing the paper.\nFor example, the actual writing of the paper, brainstorming and recording agendas for meetings.\nWe are using an all contributors model like The Turing Way’s but with our own emojis in a checklist.\nThis core team were ranked in terms of their contributions but this did create an issue of how to decide the value of different contributions and I would suggest that this should be decided firmly at the beginning.\n\nGroup 2 are those people that did not actively write the paper but are active in the Brainhack community so they ran events, gave talks or led a project.\nThese members were listed alphabetically.\n\nGroup 3 is the last author.\nIt was decided to be the Brainhack community (not by name but part of the community).\nThere were some discussions about a web list of names.\n\nWe did have to revisit these guidelines.\n\nIsil:  Just to add to this, the groups were formed organically as a bottom-up process and kept open to participation at any point in time through data collection and writing processes.\n\nDue to the personal time schedules and commitments, some people were only able to be present at the beginning of the discussions and some were present throughout the whole time or some were able to contribute at the end.\nHowever, at the end of the day, we tried to do our best to quantify any contributions given at any time point throughout the process independent of the amount of presence that had been shown.\n\n5. How have you gone about paper writing practically?\n\nRemi: We started by brainstorming to break the paper into different sections and then created sub teams, where each team worked on one section.\nThere were at least 4 teams.\n\nThere was also a master editing team to unify all these sections and another team to work on the figures, tables and glossary.\n\nVery early on we realised that the paper would be this fixed thing.\nHowever, we wanted there to be an evolving version.\nWe were restricted with the word limit to the paper and we wanted to spill over with all the ideas and keep evolving so we started a Jupyter book.\nSo there is also a team working on the \n\nJupyter book.\n\nOnce all of the sections were written and then passed to the editing team, they were sent to the co-authors.\n\nWe took lots of notes in meetings and fed this back to all co-authors.\nAll meetings were recorded and videos made available.\n\nOnce the paper was finished we sent it out for Community review.\nThis was done by putting the pre-print online for any contributors to check.\n\nThen another meeting took place with the core team to finalise these comments.\nThe community review followed the example of the \n\nINCF - A standards organisation for open and FAIR neuroscience.\n\nIsil: The teams for the sections were self-organized by those members who wanted to share their ideas and experiences in that particular domain such as educational aspect, community building or projects.\nThere was no clear cut division between these section teams, the members were fluid across the teams as needed.\n\nAlthough this was helpful given the race we were in against the time in completing the tasks at hand, making this organisation more explicit between the members of the teams might have given greater opportunities for contributions from more contributors who represent a larger variety of backgrounds and opinions.\n\n6. What have been the problems with doing this?\n\nRemi: We under specified the ranking system for the core team.\nWe did not want the core team to do the ranking, we wanted more of a bottom up approach.\nLike a tiering system of what their contributions were.\n\nWe wanted to use the contributions checklist to rank people such as the number of boxes that they had ticked.\nWe tried to go about this by ranking people in subteams, but this made people very uncomfortable.\nThe community ethos was against a ranking system and also it was unclear that they would not rank themselves.\nThis lack of clarity made it hard to decide how to make a change to this system once it was in place.\nThe process needed to be slowed down and discussed more thoroughly about how to rank people fairly.\nDecisions were finally made about how to rank authors by a core team.\nBut it was time constraints and the ever increasing people onboarding to the community that caused an issue.\n\nFor other publications we will probably just use the ‘Brainhack community’ as consortium authorship.\nEach person’s name will appear underneath the community name as a list and therefore all named authors will get the citation.\nThis will make our authorship more equitable.\n\nIsil: Remi has touched upon the many important points above.\n\nJust to add, one of the difficulties we also had was to have a full representation of the Brainhack community in this beautiful work.\nThe nature of the Brainhack community has made it a real challenge to trace back all the contributors and have them involved in the publication process.\nIt is a voluntary based organization that has had events all around the world since 2012.\nSometimes these events are run as stand-alone events, or under the roof of the yearly organized Brainhack Global or even by one of the biggest international neuroscience society - Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) - through their yearly conference.\n\nBecause of his past leadership and many other involvements in OHBM Brainhack events, Remi at the OHBM side and I personally at the Brainhack Global side, we spent weeks tracing back to these Brainhack organizers and attendees, chasing the changed affiliations, and persuading them they should be in this project and why it matters for the future of the Open science and the community itself. There were, however, still missing members or data to be represented in this whole process.\n\nI believe this is a difficulty in writing a paper that strives to engage and embrace an inclusive and representative approach.\nWe want differing ideas, backgrounds and experiences at its heart but we have to deal with the aforementioned struggles.\n\nTherefore, I also strongly believe that adopting an accumulative ‘Brainhack community’ consortium authorship model would create better, fair and equal opportunities for the representation of every single member of the community.\nThis will create a better chance of incentivizing and acknowledging the years of commitments and efforts given by each member of the community.\n\n7. What collaborative tools did you use for the writing and projects?\n\nRemi: We used Google docs and sheets.\nAlso forms for information from authors.\nBut some Google tools are not accessible in some countries such as China.\nSo it is good to have a discussion about what tools to use so that everyone has access to the same software and tools from the start.\n\nIsil: Also since we had a lot of supplementary details regarding the years-long events and projects that were run under Brainhack events, that was not able to go into the paper due to the limitation of the word count.\nWe created a supplementary Jupyterbook for which we had a public repository on Github, that is constituted of markdown files for the content of the book, .json files for the data to process and many graphics to summarise the data.\n\nRecent article from the Brainhack community: Gau R, Noble S, Heuer K, Bottenhorn KL, Bilgin IP, Yang YF, Huntenburg JM, Bayer JMM, Bethlehem RAI, Rhoads SA, Vogelbacher C, Borghesani V, Levitis E, Wang HT, Van Den Bossche S, Kobeleva X, Legarreta JH, Guay S, Atay SM, Varoquaux GP, Huijser DC, Sandström MS, Herholz P, Nastase SA, Badhwar A, Dumas G, Schwab S, Moia S, Dayan M, Bassil Y, Brooks PP, Mancini M, Shine JM, O’Connor D, Xie X, Poggiali D, Friedrich P, Heinsfeld AS, Riedl L, Toro R, Caballero-Gaudes C, Eklund A, Garner KG, Nolan CR, Demeter DV, Barrios FA, Merchant JS, McDevitt EA, Oostenveld R, Craddock RC, Rokem A, Doyle A, Ghosh SS, Nikolaidis A, Stanley OW, Uruñuela E; Brainhack Community.

What is the normal practice of authorship for academic papers in your discipline? or used to be the normal practice?\n\nWe are an interdisciplinary project and therefore bring with us the usual practices of authorship from two distinct disciplines: Computational linguistics and the Humanities (History). This makes it trickier when trying to decide how to tackle authorship on our publications.\n\nSome of our team are Computational linguists, which is a scientific field concerned with modelling language computationally. In the project, we use natural language processing that is the engineering side of Computational linguistics. We are used to working on papers that have a team of authors and papers are produced and published at pace.\n\nOther team members are from Humanities disciplines where sole author papers are common and are even required for career progression. The pace of publication in humanities is much slower.\n\nThese two different approaches to authorship make it very hard to establish who should be an author or who should just be acknowledged. It is also difficult to work out who contributed the most, therefore establishing a ranking order of authors for papers, as we all have different roles in the project that are equally important to the overall goals.\n\nThe publications we have published so far are more focused on the computational linguistics side of the project and therefore we have been generous with authorship for the whole team. This is due to the acceptance in computational linguistics that a team would have worked together to achieve this work.\n\nHowever, when writing more historically based papers we may need to consider that some of our team members need sole author publications and that adding authors onto these papers devalues the perceived prestige of the paper for them. In this case, we will be careful to fully cite our previous technical papers and acknowledge all of the team in an acknowledgement section.\n\n2. When did you discuss authorship in your project?\n\nWe started this process early but did not make much progress really until the first major paper of the project was about to be submitted. We then had to decide how to properly credit everyone in our team and it was driven by the need to get it done.\n\n3. Who had the discussion of authorship in your project?\n\nEveryone was involved in the discussions about authorship in meetings led by the Principal Investigator - Professor Ruth Ahnert. All our voices were listened to in these discussions and the approach to authorship in the project had good intentions from the start.\n\nThe discussions were very interdisciplinary as the project has a lot of postdoctoral researchers that all bring with them expert knowledge.\n\n4. What approach have you decided to take in your project?\n\nWe adopted the \n\nCRediT taxonomy to better present each author’s contributions to the work. However, we felt it does not cover all the roles in our project so we adapted it. We felt that some of the categories were a bit vague and we wanted to be specific about the roles played by our team members.\n\nThe categories that we added were implementation, reproducibility, interpretation, historical analysis and annotation.\n\nWe encountered an issue with the roles that were not being perceived equally, such as conceptualisation and supervision being seen as having more prestige than other roles. Therefore, even when trying to acknowledge team members contributions more inclusively there are still problems that arise.\n\nWe decided to produce a cover page for the pre-print of our first methods paper. We wanted to reflect our thinking about moving away from an author list and raise the curtain on roles that are often hidden in research projects.\n\nThe cover page makes the jobs on the project more explicit, you therefore do not presume what the authors do as you would with a list.\n\nYou can find out more about this in our blog - \n\nHighlighting authors’ contributions and interdisciplinary collaborations in Living with Machines.\n\nAs we are trying to challenge how things are usually done, we were expecting this approach to bring conflicts and difficult discussions. Everyone came to this project with a similar mindset and this helped us to resolve any issues.\n\n5. How have you gone about this practically?\n\nWe used a Google doc to send around the CRediT taxonomy and everyone could fill in their own name under the different categories.\n\nWe did find that everyone had different opinions - some people did put themselves in many categories and others would only put their name in one when they should have got credit for more.\n\nThis meant that there had to be a degree of moderation when finalising the list of contributions.\n\n6. What have been the problems with doing this?\n\nThe cover page was a statement that was put in our pre-print to try to solve the issue of assigning contributions fairly and the need for a list of authors but it was a footnote in the final published article. Therefore, there still had to be a list of authors, and a first author for publication.\n\nThe main author, Mariona, was easy to decide as she had been the main writer and lead in everything to do with that paper but after that the order of authors was difficult.\n\nSome team members don’t have the same need for publications as postdoctoral researchers because they hold permanent positions or work in areas where other types of outputs, such as code, are more important. This adds another layer of consideration that needs to be addressed when discussing the author list.\n\nThere are also issues with assigning corresponding authors as in some fields this carries a perception of supervision or seniority in the team. In our case, it was just who was best to contact to find out more about the project.\n\n7. How are you approaching the writing of the papers?\n\nWe had one person leading on a publication. They defined the structure, had an understanding of what was expected by the journal in terms of structure and formatting, they split up the paper into sections for different people to write and then everyone could write their parts. Then one person edited this work. It does need one person to edit the whole paper so they can have an idea of the overall flow and structure.\n\nThis approach worked well for the technical papers we have written.\n\n8. What collaborative tools are you using for the writing and projects?\n\nWe are using Overleaf, which is a LaTex based writing software, but I think some people are using Google docs for collaborative writing.\n\nThis interview was conducted by Emma Karoune. We would like to thank Federico and Mariona for the useful discussions about academic authorship, and for commenting on this personal story and the wider academic authorship chapter.","type":"content","url":"/communication/aa/aa-stories-interdisciplinary#find-out-more-about-their-work-below","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right","lvl2":"Establish who wants to be an author"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips#cm-aa-tips-who","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right","lvl2":"Establish who wants to be an author"},"content":"It is worth considering that not everyone on the same research project or in the same community will have the same motivation when it comes to authorship.\nNot everyone places the same importance on academic citation rates and therefore this is an issue that needs to be considered at the start of a project.\n\nStrong motivation\nThere will be team members that are focused on an academic career path and feel paper authorship is a driving force for career progression.\nThey will put high importance on being an author and probably will also have strong opinions on how they want authorship to be attributed and what order authors names should take.\n\nMedium motivation\nOther team members, probably more established academics who already have a substantial amount of publications and in stable employment, may be less worried about the order of authors on their papers or how contributions are attributed and tracked.\n\nLow motivation\nTeam members that are not interested in a purely academic career but still are an integral part of the team and have made substantial contributions to the project, such as research engineers, may not be interested in authorship at all.","type":"content","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips#cm-aa-tips-who","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right","lvl2":"Encourage a culture of ethical and equitable authorship"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips#cm-aa-tips-culture","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right","lvl2":"Encourage a culture of ethical and equitable authorship"},"content":"There may be unethical practices that exist in your discipline, or even in your institution, but this does not mean that you have to follow them.\nYou can implement a more ethical and equitable authorship approach in your own research.\n\nFind out about your own institution’s authorship policy or make one yourself.\n\nIf you know what journal you are going to target for your publications, then find out about their authorship policy.\n\nRead about ethical authorship such as on the \n\nCommittee on Publication Ethics (COPE) website.","type":"content","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips#cm-aa-tips-culture","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right","lvl2":"Plan an authorship strategy early on in a project"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/communication/aa/aa-tips#cm-aa-tips-plan","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Getting Authorship Right","lvl2":"Plan an authorship strategy early on in a project"},"content":"The earlier that authorship is discussed, the more awareness project members will have.\nThis will hopefully lead to less conflict about authorship when it comes to the paper writing stage of the project.\n\nIt is not good practice to wait until you have finished writing a paper to have these discussions and this could lead to a lot of problems.\n\nHave a discussion about authorship at the outset of the project or even in the planning stage.

them correctly and in such a way that they are not influenced or come into conflict with other software that may be running on your machine.\nIt’s a lot of work!\n\nHow much easier would it be if we could run code in the browser, similar to how it’s displayed?\nThis is what Project Binder aims to achieve.\n\nProject Binder provides a user with the following infrastructure:\n\nsome hardware to execute code, usually a server hosted in the cloud but can be on-premise hardware too;\n\na computational environment containing:\n\nthe appropriate software,\n\nany extra package dependencies,\n\nany required input data,\n\nand a copy of the code itself (Notebooks or scripts);\n\na URL to where the environment is running so the code can be interacted with by you or your collaborators.\n\nProject Binder has packaged together all of the moving parts that make it challenging to share computational work into a simple to use interface.\nThere is a free and public version of this interface running at \n\nmybinder.org.\n\nThe cartoon below, by Juliette Taka, demonstrates one workflow a that scientist using Binder might adopt.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Figure credit: \n\nJuliette Taka, Logilab and the

technological output of this project is a \n\nBinderHub.\n\nBinderHub: A cloud-based infrastructure for generating Binders.\nThe most widely-used is \n\nmybinder.org, which is maintained by the Project Binder team.\nIt is built upon a range of open source tools, including \n\nJupyterHub, for providing cloud compute resources to users via a browser; and \n\nrepo2docker, for building docker images from projects.\nSince it is an open project, it is possible to create other BinderHubs which can support more specialised configurations.\nOne such configuration could include authentication to enable private repositories to be shared amongst close collaborators.\n\nA Binder: A sharable version of a project that can be viewed and interacted within a reproducible computational environment running in the cloud via a web browser.\nBy automating the installation of the computing environment (as discussed in the \n\nReproducible Environments chapter), Project Binder transforms the overhead of sharing such an environment into the act of sharing a URL.\n\nmybinder.org: A public and free BinderHub.\nBecause it is public, you should not use it if your project requires any personal or

a free, anonymous service in the cloud is a lot of voluntary work and costs a lot of money.\nIn order to reduce the running costs somewhat, \n\nmybinder.org places computational restrictions on each running Binder instance.\nThese restrictions are:\n\n1 CPU, and\n\n1 GB of RAM.\n\nHence, \n\nmybinder.org is not an appropriate place to perform end-to-end replications of Machine Learning workflows, for example!\n\nAnd this is the primary reason why this chapter on Binder has been placed in the “Guide for Communication”.\nWith these computational restrictions, \n\nmybinder.org lends itself very well to hosting interactive demonstrations and learning resources for software packages or research analyses.\nIn this scenario, the people clicking the Binder link probably want to learn something, and sitting through a time-consuming model-training process likely won’t help them achieve that.\nInstead, you could provide pre-trained models or instructions on how to train the models on their own hardware and come back to the Binder for the remainder of the interactive tutorial.\n\nSo, when is it appropriate to use \n\nmybinder.org?\n\nWhen you want to communicate something in an interactive manner, such as short analyses, tutorials, or even blogs!\nCheck out \n\nAchintya Rao’s blog powered by mybinder.org!\n\nWhen the code and associated data (if relevant) are publicly available\n\nWhen

to be written regularly and can be used to build momentum on a particular issue, event or project.\nIn this way, blog posts suit research projects, particularly open projects and communities, because there can be frequent updates of activities and findings to bring greater attention and therefore transparency to your work.\n\nStarting a blog does take some investment as a web platform needs to be

in the \n\nGuide for Project Design.\n\nKeep in mind that there are usually many different audiences that consume the same content you publish in each of the media that we’ll cover in this chapter.\n\nChange your style - Academic writing is often very formal and uses a lot of passive voice such as ‘the authors suggest ...’.\nThis style does not suit a non-academic audience and therefore your writing needs to be adapted to suit the audience you are aiming for.\n\nMake it accessible - As well as making the technical level of your writing lower, you also need to get rid of any commonly used abbreviations used in your discipline or at least make sure that you explain them.\nEach discipline has its acronyms that even other scientific fields do not understand.\nThere are also issues concerning different audiences being physically able to access the output that must be considered.\nRemoving as many barriers to research communication as possible will increase its

describing all the metadata (methodology of data collection) and providing a digital object identifier (DOI) for the dataset.\n\nBut writing a data paper does not just increase the findability, it also increases the accessibility of your data.\nAnother part of the FAIR principles is that metadata are retrievable by their identifier (A1).\nA data paper provides this by having a separate DOI associated with the article and therefore the description of your data (metadata).\n\nIt increases your number of articles and also citations\n\nResearch culture, research impact and career progression is still linked to the number of journal articles researchers publish and what journals they publish in.We therefore need to convert the effort we make in producing sustainable datasets (open or restricted in repositories) into the impact gained from publishing journal articles.\nA data paper adds another published peer-reviewed article on top of your research article for the same project and gives credit to the researchers that take time to implement good data stewardship practices.\n\nData papers are quick to write and also tend to come back from review quickly so there is generally a quick turn around for those in need of bolstering their publication lists.\n\nWith this increase in publications will obviously come an increase in citations for you.\nSo writing a data paper means more impact for your research!\n\nReproducibility and sustainability\n\nThe transparency produced by writing down your methodology in a structured way in a data paper means that your research will be easier for others to understand, reproduce and reuse.\nA data paper accompanied with a research compendium attached to a research article is a great way to signal to others that your research is reproducible.\nYou are providing a more transparent record of your research.\n\nBeing more open and transparent, and particularly taking a reproducible research approach, makes your research more sustainable.\nBut why is this such a good thing?\nPublishing research that has the ability to be fully reviewed, so that means the protocols, data, and code as well as your interpretations and conclusions, means that it can be fully validated.\nOther researchers can have more trust in the quality of the research and therefore, reuse any part of it with confidence.\nThe research has more longevity and therefore is more cost effective.\n\nThis is especially important when it comes to developing new scientific methods for applied sciences.\nThe methods need to be robust so that the investigations using them and subsequent interpretations made from the results must hold up to scrutiny.","type":"content","url":"/communication/dif-articles/data#picking-out-three-of-these-that-are-particularly-important","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Papers","lvl2":"How do you write a Data Paper?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/communication/dif-articles/data#cm-dif-articles-data-how","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Papers","lvl2":"How do you write a Data Paper?"},"content":"First you need to deposit the dataset in an open repository of your choice.\nThis can be done for free using one of many free open repositories such as Zenodo, Open Science Framework or Figshare.\nIn most cases, a data paper will link to an open dataset but this may not be possible  with sensitive data.\nHowever, with sensitive data you will be able to link to a restricted dataset and in this case it is important you provide detailed information about how to apply to get access to the data in the data availability statement in the data paper.\n\nDepositing a dataset in a repository will provided you with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the dataset, you can then write your article using a data paper template provided by a data journal and link the dataset to this paper by writing the DOI in the data availability statement.\n\nFor data journals, the data paper templates are all very similar and include sections such as:\n\nBackground and summary -

like students leaving the lab to get a publication out quickly.\n\nMicropublications are easy to put together - the journals that publish them are very flexible with format and the barrier for publishing them is low.\n\nBy publishing your smaller outputs you also get credit by having it as a citable research object.\nThis sharing of smaller outputs gets your work out into the community with

researchers detail their proposed methods, hypotheses and analyses in a published study protocol.\nThis is then peer reviewed, allowing authors to refine their methodology from reviewer feedback if needed.\nThe protocol is then provisionally accepted, meaning it will be published by the journal if the authors conduct the experiment in accordance with their approved protocol.\nThe authors then carry out their registered methodology for their study.\n\nOnce the study is complete, authors write and publish a research article, which includes results and interpretations.\nThis is also peer

by putting the importance of the methodology and research question first.\nBy pre-registering your planned method and analyses, this eliminates questionable research practices such as selective reporting of results, including low statistical power, p-hacking and HARKing.\nIt also allows you to get useful feedback and improve on your study design.\n\nA huge benefit of publishing a registered report is avoiding publication bias.\nIt can be difficult to publish negative or ‘less novel’ results in journals.\nThe registered report format means that when you have your protocol approved, your research article is provisionally accepted for publication and will be published regardless of whether you get negative results or not.\n\nThis frees up researchers to be rewarded for simply doing good and transparent science without having to sell an impactful story about their research.\n\nRegistered reports are also a useful format for researchers who want to carry out replication studies and other novel, resource-intensive projects that may otherwise be too risky to attempt where successful publication is contingent on the results.

Interviewed by Marta Mangiarulo.\n\nWhy did you choose to publish a Registered Report?\n\nI was inspired to write a registered report by a talk given by Chris Chambers at my university.\nI realised that the projects for my doctoral thesis would have benefited from a clear design upfront.\nI was the first one to try this at my institution, so I also took it as a career challenge to improve my scientific practices and perhaps convince others that the undertaking was not so difficult.\n\nHow did you get started?\n\nI did some searching in the literature and tried to find some examples of previous registered reports.\nThere weren’t many examples, but I found it useful to look into the presentation notes that Prof. Chambers generously made available for advice.\n\nWhat impact do you think your Registered Report made/is making to your research/project/community?\n\nAfter my initial submission, I was invited to share my experience as part of a series of talks at my university.\nI think my talks helped make registered reports and standard pre-registration less exotic than they initially seemed, although I am not aware of any specific research that adopted either procedure.\n\nWhat tools/software did you use most in your Registered Report work?\n\nMy original registered report was based on the recommendations from the journal I originally submitted it to (Royal Society Open Science).\nAfter that, I mostly relied upon the Open Science Framework’s standard pre-registration format: it has improved quite a bit since I first used it, and I think it nudges researchers into providing more details than other pre-registration forms such as the ones from \n\naspredicted.org\n\nDo you have any top tips for other people that might be interested in preregistering their research?\n\nSteal from others’ preregistrations.\nIt really helps to jump-start stalled registrations.\nAnd – general advice – don’t underestimate the importance of literature research to improve your design, especially for methods-heavy registrations.\nFor example, I happened to find an improved operationalisation of a dependent variable right after I had pre-registered my study.\nI do not consider it a big problem to amend the pre-registration, but it is neater if you don’t have to!\n\nDo you have any tips on things to avoid?\n\nDo not write your pre-registration right before running your experiment.\nWriting things down is useful because it forces you to find the blind spots in your reasoning.\nI would suggest that you start writing as soon as you have the idea.\n\nIs there anything else that you want to add to the interview that has not been covered in the questions above?\n\nPreregistrations are not meant for all research questions out there.\nLet’s not forget about the importance of exploratory questions and how they can expand our pre-registered hypotheses.\nKeeping the focus of a pre-registration restricted to our main hypotheses does not mean that we cannot then explore all the unexpected ramifications of the study results.","type":"content","url":"/communication/dif-articles/reg#cm-dif-articles-registered-reports-personal","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Software

Website\n\nBlog: \n\nThe Open Archaeobotanist\n\nX (formerly Twitter): \n\nekaroune\n\nWe would like to thank Emma for answering our interview questions about her work with \n\nPalaeoSIG, the special interest group for palaeoecology at the British Ecological Society.\n\nComments are also made in this case study by Dr Althea Davies and Dr Jane Bunting, who are the Secretaries of the PalaeoSIG and the organisers of this project along with Dr Eileen Tisdall.\n\n1. Why did you start your work on lay summaries?\n\nI attended an online workshop that PalaeoSIG organised in spring 2020 about \n\nscience writing and communication.\nThis was run by Althea Davies (University St Andrews), Jane Bunting (University Hull) and Eileen Tisdall (University Stirling).\nThis workshop aimed to train palaeoecologists to communicate their research more effectively with non-specialists.\nAs part of the workshop, we were tasked to produce short, accessible summaries of articles that had been suggested as the most influential palaeoecological papers in a recent Palaeoecology special interest group survey and these would then be disseminated in a blog.\n\n2. How did you get started?\n\nDuring the workshop, we were put into pairs so that we could work collaboratively on writing our two lay summaries.\nMy collaborator and I opted to work in Google docs so that we could start documents for the first draft of each lay summary separately but we could also then go on to collaborate in real-time to edit and discuss our writing using the built-in editing and commenting features.\n\nHere is one of the lay summaries I wrote with my workshop partner Nick Loughlin - \n\nNew evidence to assess the 5 reasons Elm almost disappeared.\n\nOnce the workshop was over, we were asked if anyone wanted to help with editing and publishing the lay summaries.\nSome of us then formed a group of copy editors and summary editors, again to work in pairs to finalise each lay summary every week for release on the project website.\nThe aim was to release one lay summary a week for a whole year.\n\n3. What impact do you think your lay summaries are making to your research/project/community?\n\nAlthea told me that the WordPress site has between c.80 and 530 views per month, depending on how many posts we have.\nAs to what impact they’re having, she is not sure how to measure this.\nAlthea commented that they didn’t set out to be an ‘influencer’ looking for a high hit rate, rather more of a support mechanism, point of connection and community resource for palaeoscientists working in various disciplines and sectors.\nFor instance, providing an opportunity for blogs by Early Career Researchers who might be unsure about offering one to a ‘bigger’ organisation, like a journal.\n\n4. What tools/software do you use most in your lay summaries?\n\nThe Palaeoecology special interest group used Google Drive to run the project as Google Docs were used to write collaboratively and Google Sheets were used to coordinate the lay summaries and the editing and publishing progress.\nThis allowed us to work synchronously during the workshop and asynchronously over the whole time of the project.\n\nThe blog website uses WordPress.\nAlthea said that she found uploading blogs quite straightforward and this probably reflects Jane’s initial setup choices as well as the simplicity of the WordPress format and templates.\n\n5. Do you have any top tips for other people that might be interested in starting lay summaries?\n\nWriting lay summaries is a different type of writing so you do have to learn how to do it.\nThe workshop training helped everyone to improve their writing skills as we were given lectures by an expert scientific editor from a popular science news website.\nThis helped me to think about the differences between academic writing and writing for lay audiences.\n\nAlso, you need to write to someone.\nCollaboration is the key to success as another pair of eyes helps to refine and improve your writing further.\n\n6. Do you have any tips on things to avoid?\n\nDon’t leave in any technical words - this might seem a very hard thing to achieve but there is always a way you can explain or describe them simply instead.\nIf you do have to include a technical word, you should put a definition in brackets or a link to a website that explains the term simply such as Wikipedia.\n\n7. Where do you see your lay summaries writing skills going in the future?\n\nI have found these skills really useful for several reasons.\nI had to write a lay summary for a recent article I submitted so it helped me to think about how to change my writing style compared to the abstract.\n\nI have also started a new job in the last year that was a project outside of my particular discipline and my first task was to edit lay summaries.\nThis gave me a different perspective about how important they are for clear communication within projects for team members with different specialisms.","type":"content","url":"/communication/lay-summaries/lay-summaries-personal-stories#emma-karoune-making-palaeoecology-more-accessible","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Scholarship"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/communication/open","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Scholarship"},"content":"\n\nFigure 1:The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

example, there is evidence that \n\nstudents may avoid paying for text books at the expense of their academic success.\n\nIs easier to use:\n\nEasier to build upon and correct the materials, which facilitates customisation of your education curriculum.\n\nEasier to collaborate, participate and share resources.\n\nReduces duplication of effort: If an educator needs materials for teaching and they can access open materials, then they need not make their own from scratch, thereby saving time.\n\nIs generally more accessible due to the use of open formats compared to proprietary formats in which files cannot be changed.\n\nFormats like Microsoft docx are proprietary, so preference should be given to open formats such as ODT and HTML work with a variety of software.\n\nWhile .pdf is an open format, it is also more closed in the sense that it is difficult to edit compared to formats such as RTF and HTML.\n\nAccessibility is not guaranteed!\nLearn more about how to improve the

someone already, then issue tracking in a centralised system is a good option and it does not necessarily need to be circulated to your wider community.\n\nHowever in terms of engaging your community, such a centralised system can be problematic.\nIf your issues are elsewhere this can create a lot of barriers to entry for community members, such as:\n\nIssues are more difficult to discover\n\nIf

they are referencing\n\nA very large impact on the community of having a separate issue board is that when people visit your code repository, it looks like an inactive project because there are no

The journal you are reviewing for may also provide guidance on how to write a review.\nIf you are reviewing for the first time, this workflow might be useful.\n\nIt might be a good idea to read a paper twice.\nFirst, go over the paper superficially and quickly. This gets you a sense of where the authors are going.\n\nAfter a quick glance at the paper, you can determine whether you think the paper has the potential to be published, perhaps after revisions.\nIf you think the paper is beyond repair, explain this to the editor.\n\nIf the paper is good enough to be revised and resubmitted, you can start providing more detailed comments.\n\nThe second time you go over the paper, do a very close reading.\nSome of the information may be in the supplementary information provided with the paper - read them carefully as well.\n\nThe tone of the review\nThere is a ‘golden rule’ for people writing a review: treat others as you would like to be treated.\nWrite the review report that you would have liked to receive if you had been the author.\nThe following principles might help you:\n\nBe honest but constructive.\nYou are not at war.\nThere is no need to burn a paper to the ground.\n\nAvoid addressing the authors personally.\nSay: “the paper could benefit from…” instead of “the authors need”.\n\nStay close to the facts.\nDo not speculate about reasons why the authors have made certain choices beyond the arguments stated in the paper.\n\nTake a developmental approach.\nAny paper will contain flaws and imperfections.\nYour job is to improve science by identifying problems and suggesting ways to repair them.\nThink with the authors about ways they can improve the paper in such a way that it benefits collective scholarship.\n\nTry to see beyond bad writing style and mistakes in spelling.\nAlso be mindful of disciplinary and cultural differences between the authors and yourself.\n\nThe substance of the advice\n\nIt is a good principle to begin the review report by describing the way you reviewed the paper.\nIf you searched for literature, checked the data and verified the results, ran additional analyses, state this.\nIt will allow the editor to adjudicate the review.\n\nThen give a brief overview of the paper.\nInclude a two- or three-sentence summary with your interpretation of the hypothesis, main results and conclusions.\nThis summary provides the author an indication of the clarity of their paper.\n\nIf the invitation asks you to provide a general recommendation, state it early in the review.\nThe recommendation is the first thing the editor wants to know.\nTypically, you are invited to recommend ‘reject’, ‘revise & resubmit’ – with major or minor revisions, or ‘accept’.\n\nMajor revisions are needed when the conclusions are jeopardized by concerns or the usefulness of the data is limited.\nExamples are problems with the applied methods, analyses, or the reasoning.\nReviewers should indicate the seriousness of the major concern and how it could be addressed.\nIf the concern cannot be addressed it may be better to ‘reject’ the work.\nOnly suggest additional analyses or testing only when the conclusions of the study are otherwise undermined - otherwise they can be addressed in a future paper.\n\nMinor revisions are needed to improve the clarity of the paper.\nMinor revisions can include additional citations, addition of details regarding the method, change in title or abstract to reflect the paper content, whether figures are clear, necessarily and in correspondence with the text and any presentation issues (spelling errors, wording).\n\nUse ‘reject’ only if absolutely necessary.\nMost journal editors make use of desk-rejection if the paper seems a poor fit; if the editor sent the paper out for review, she probably thinks it has the potential to be published.\nStart from the assumption that the authors have invested a great deal of time in the paper and that they want to improve it.\n\nList the strengths and the weaknesses of the paper.\nTo ease the message you can use the sandwich principle: start with the strengths, then discuss the weaknesses, and conclude with an encouragement.\n\nTry to give actionable advice.\nFor the weaknesses in the paper, suggest ways to repair them.\nConstructive criticism does not have to be in the form of a specific solution.\nIt can be much more useful to be specific about the problem and to let the authors identify a solution, than it is to provide the fix for them.\nIt is convenient for both the editor and the authors to number your suggestions.\nDistinguish major issues, such as not discussing alternative explanations, from minor issues such as missing references and typos.\nThere could be points that the authors are underselling.\nIn that case, you could identify them as strengths that the authors can emphasize more strongly.\nIt is handy to refer to issues with direct quotes and page numbers or line numbers.\n\nTraditionally, the review process is designed to be anonymous. However, some reviewers sign their reviews.\nA non-anonymous review can be seen as an accountability device: by exposing who they are to the authors of the paper, the reviewers set higher standards for themselves. This needs to be done carefully: some editors do not appreciate signed reviews.\nThere are voices that express concerns for a graduate student or an early career researcher facing retribution for being critical of a more senior researcher.\nThere is also a process called open peer review; in this case, the review is open for everyone viewing the paper.\nThe peer review might blend these features; for example, one might be able to see the review text but not the name of the reviewer who did it, or the name of the reviewer but not the text itself.\nThe design of the peer review process and its transparency varies from journal to journal.\nGenerally there is a way to communicate just with the editor, for example, via confidential remarks.\nThis communication is not provided to the authors, so you can be candid here about your limitations and concerns regarding the submitted paper.\n\nSecond round of reviewing process\nIf the authors have revised their paper, check if your suggestions have been implemented or whether sufficient arguments have been provided to not do so.\nIt is a good principle to avoid making new demands for the second round that you have not made before.","type":"content","url":"/communication/peer-review/peer-review-guidance#how-to-organize-the-review-work","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Peer Review"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/communication/peer-review/peer-review-open","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Peer Review"},"content":"\n\nFigure 1:The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

Do you have any top tips for other people that might be interested in starting a podcast?"},"content":"Emma - Decide on your audience and cater to them, what are their concerns and interests?\nCreate material that reflects those things.\n\nIt is incredibly hard to relax ‘on tape’, even if you are a good public speaker.\nIt is normal to feel anxious so don’t be surprised if you get very tense.\nThe best thing to do to overcome this is to press record and then just chat with people, even do some warm-up/ice breaker type exercises to get everyone comfortable.\n\nYou will hate your voice, everybody does, but you will learn to accept it in time.\nAim to speak normally, as you would to someone sitting next to you. Smile when you speak, it makes a difference.\n\nAlways ensure you get people to say their name at least once on the recording so you have the correct pronunciation (and check people’s preferred pronouns too).\n\nTake some brief notes as they speak so you can come back to earlier points or ask follow-up questions.\n\nAim for quality, not quantity, better to have one great episode a month than four okay ones.\nHowever, if you are looking to have a large audience it is probably best to be weekly or biweekly.\n\nZoe - Do it as a conversation and have an idea of the audience in mind.\nMake sure that you ask questions to get the information for listeners to put ideas into practice - empower people to take action.\n\nIf you are trying to start a listener base, then try to interview people that have a lot of followers on Twitter so they can retweet.\n\nAlso, make sure you block the whole day for the interview as it is time-consuming and takes up a lot of energy.","type":"content","url":"/communication/podcasts/podcasts-personal-stories#id-5-do-you-have-any-top-tips-for-other-people-that-might-be-interested-in-starting-a-podcast","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Podcasts","lvl2":"6.

Do you have any advice on things to avoid or, perhaps, to handle with care?"},"content":"I think you have to be very careful with humour.\nI think that this aspect works only on oneself, if I laugh at myself, then there is less risk of offending or hurting someone.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to avoid being impolite regarding schedules.\nFor example, if a talk lasts an hour, it would be convenient to finish it within 50 minutes and leave the participant ten minutes to stretch, get up, hydrate themselves or go to the bathroom and then continue with their routine, especially in this virtual setting where we live from one Zoom to another.\n\nIf you don’t know how long it will take you, it’s best to practice it beforehand in front of your pet, your family, or a community.\nAs you get the hang of it, you know how long the talk or concept is going to take, and whether it needs to be shortened or stretched depending on the time.\n\nAnother thing I would try to avoid is not leaving time to interact with people.\nAt some point, you have to interact with the people who attended the event, either during the talk, in the end, or when you feel more comfortable.\nIf you just deliver the talk, finish and leave, you lose the possibility of generating contacts or being approachable, which are two of the main goals of this type of event.\n\nRegarding the materials, make sure that they are accessible.\nAs I mentioned before, work to make them as accessible as possible (legible fonts, contrasting sizes and colours, speaker’s notes, alternative text in the images) and that they are licensed.\n\nWhen I prepare a talk, when budgeting the time it takes me to put it together, I add a day or two more to check its accessibility.\nThe license is fundamental to let your audience know how they can reuse your material and, if they cannot reuse it, to make it clear.\n\nFinally, a very Argentine phrase: “Don’t get up on your high horse”; deliver the talk with the peace of mind that comes from knowing your work and your discipline, but also with fitting humility.\nYou have to acknowledge that there may be questions that you do not know how to answer.\n\nThe same goes for language, where you can be technically correct without using complex language.\nHowever, if you use technical terms because you have to, you have to explain them or make an analogy with everyday things.\nFor example, a computer program is like a recipe: you give instructions to the computer.\nThat is why it is key to know your audience, as then you know what to rely on when explaining more complex concepts.\n\nWe are discussing talks given at community events.\nIn general, I deliver them free of charge and the materials are open, but if a company invites you, don’t be ashamed or afraid to charge for them in case that, later on, it will be economically profitable for whoever invites you.\nI also don’t pay out of my pocket if I am invited to give a talk; this means that the costs of travel or registration are paid by the organizer.\nIf your talks are in high demand, the organizer’s handling of the costs helps you decide.\nAlso, you should never transfer the intellectual property of your material to the event organizer.\nIf organizers ask you to transfer your rights you should charge them for it.\n\nIn my case, the talks I deliver are related to Data Science, with Agricultural Sciences and communities of practice.\nIf I am invited to deliver a talk as an INTA researcher, I do not charge for it either, because it is part of my job.\nWhen I am invited to deliver a talk due to my involvement in communities of practice or for events not related to INTA, if they are for public universities, for example, organizations like R-Ladies, or free events and conferences, I accept as a way of giving back a big part of what I received.\nI live in a country that allowed me to receive education in a public system that is funded by all of us, and giving this kind of training is a way of giving back.\nCurrently, I’m privileged enough to be able to engage in this kind of activity without charging; not everyone is, and they don’t have to feel obligated to do it.\n\nSome people have a guideline when it comes to being invited to deliver a talk, such as \n\nTatiana Mac, \n\nGreg Wilson and Steph Locke.\n\nThese are also questions that I take into account: Is it an all-male panel?\nDoes the event have a Code of Conduct?\nIs it open access, or does it have benefits for less advantaged people?\nAgain, if one can demand these types of things in the events one is going to participate in, we will be helping to generate friendlier and safer environments.\nSometimes one does not have the possibility or the privilege to choose, so those of us who can do it.","type":"content","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-4-do-you-have-any-advice-on-things-to-avoid-or-perhaps-to-handle-with-care","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"5.

Se les puede preguntar a los organizadores del evento a quienes les vas a hablar, cuál es su background, cuál es la razón por la que vienen al evento, ya que, de esa manera, se puede prever algunas de las expectativas que van a tener e intentar, por lo menos, cumplir alguna en tu charla.\n\nAsimismo, comienzo la charla con una actitud descontracturada para que el público sienta que, a pesar de que estoy ahí como experta, soy accesible a la hora de los comentarios y preguntas. Después de todo, este tipo de encuentros e intercambios se realizan para que las personas se lleven algo, aprendan algo.\n\nConocer a tu audiencia y al menos una o dos de las expectativas que esperan de la charla es importante, ya que al cumplirla se van con algo que fueron a buscar y por eso va a contribuir a la evaluación de que valió la pena estar ahí.\n\nEse es otro punto a tener en cuenta, el respeto por el tiempo del otro y prepararte con anticipación, que se note que te importa dar una buena charla, con información útil, que se note que querés que aprovechen ese tiempo que decidieron dedicarte a vos escuchandote.\n\nEl respeto por cumplir los tiempos, también es importante, tanto para vos, el público y el resto de los oradores.\n\nEs necesario estar bien informado sobre el formato de la charla:  cantidad de tiempo de la charla, formato (ej: se expone y las preguntas al final, se puede ir haciendo preguntas durante la charla, cuánto tiempo de preguntas o intercambios se esperan), ¿hay libertad en el formato o es estructurado?.\n\nEn general, si hay libertad en el formato de la charla, pido que me dejen interactuar con el público. Me gusta hacer preguntas y que me contesten en el chat, los hace parte del evento. Luego, leo las respuestas y, a pesar de que el slide es el mismo, lo que voy a decir va a ser diferente dependiendo de las respuestas que consiga. Si el formato es estructurado respeto las instrucciones de la organización, que en general es una introducción de la disertante, la presentación y luego las preguntas.\n\nHay organizadores que te piden el material previamente para que el público lo mire y te envíen las preguntas antes de la charla. Por eso, es preciso comunicarse con los organizadores y comprender el proceso. Además, siempre pido un feedback de los organizadores para poder ir mejorando la charla.\n\nPor otro lado, intento responder lo que no se contestó en el evento de dos maneras distintas: hago un blog post con las preguntas y respuestas (a veces las agrego en la página de la charla) o con hilos de Twitter. De igual forma, procuro dejar disponibles los materiales antes de la charla y tener en cuenta cuestiones de accesibilidad, como que la fuente tenga un tamaño que sea visible, los contrastes de colores, que incluya notas del orador, un link de descarga, una licencia para que sepan cómo usarla, entre otros detalles.\n\nGracias a  R-Ladies empecé a prestar más atención a este tipo de detalles de mis materiales, cosas que antes no tenía mucho en cuenta pero pueden hacer una gran diferencia en el uso y acceso de mis charlas.","type":"content","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-2-qu-aspectos-ten-s-que-atender-a-la-hora-de-pensar-un-evento-con-charlas-muy-interdisciplinarias","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"3. ¿Qué aspectos de dar este tipo de charlas aportan a tu trabajo profesional?","lvl2":"Personal stories - Presenting outside of your discipline (Español)"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-3-qu-aspectos-de-dar-este-tipo-de-charlas-aportan-a-tu-trabajo-profesional","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"3. ¿Qué aspectos de dar este tipo de charlas aportan a tu trabajo profesional?","lvl2":"Personal stories - Presenting outside of your discipline (Español)"},"content":"Lo primero es la red de contactos que generas a partir de los eventos. El hecho de ir y contar lo que estás haciendo, me ha significado futuras colaboraciones, convenios, publicaciones, trabajos en conjunto y proyectos.\n\nAmpliar esa red de contactos también puede resultar en que uno pueda juntar a personas para que trabajen juntas.\nCreo que es un rol muy importante que poseemos las personas que ya tenemos varios años en la profesión, ser de puente entre grupos de trabajo y personas para que se conozcan.\n\nPor otra parte, me ayuda a mejorar mis charlas, mis materiales (muchos de ellos terminan en algún tipo de publicación más académica) y a tomar el pulso de cuáles son las necesidades, dudas o inquietudes de las personas con respecto al tema que estoy comunicando.\nEso me sirve como un termómetro de la demanda, de lo que las personas están necesitando; de lo que no se está entendiendo; de los temas que están haciendo falta tener una capacitación, libros, blogs o materiales; para reafirmar o corregir la dirección de mi trabajo.\n\nEsto puede terminar en la presentación de una propuesta de proyecto nuevo, la búsqueda de un financiamiento para ese proyecto.\n\nPor último, se aprende muchísimo, sobre otros temas, sobre otras profesiones, sobre otras personas y otros países.\nEn los eventos, muchas veces escuchás la charla de otras personas que están invitadas y aprendes de ellas. Además, te enteras de proyectos, accedes a la información y se te pueden presentar otras posibilidades para vos o para grupos de trabajos que conozcas.","type":"content","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-3-qu-aspectos-de-dar-este-tipo-de-charlas-aportan-a-tu-trabajo-profesional","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"4. ¿Tenés consejos sobre cosas que hay que evitar o, quizás, manejar con cuidado?","lvl2":"Personal stories - Presenting outside of your discipline (Español)"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-4-ten-s-consejos-sobre-cosas-que-hay-que-evitar-o-quiz-s-manejar-con-cuidado","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"4. ¿Tenés consejos sobre cosas que hay que evitar o, quizás, manejar con cuidado?","lvl2":"Personal stories - Presenting outside of your discipline (Español)"},"content":"Creo que con el humor hay que ser muy cuidadosa.\nPienso que ese aspecto funciona únicamente sobre uno mismo, si me río de mi, entonces hay menos riesgos de ofender o lastimar.\n\nPor otro lado, hay que evitar la descortesía de los tiempos.\nPor ejemplo, si una charla dura una hora, sería conveniente terminarla en 50 minutos y dejarle al participante diez minutos para que se estire, levante, hidrate o vaya al baño y, luego, que continúe con su rutina, especialmente en este ámbito virtual donde vivimos de un zoom a otro.\n\nSi no sabes cuánto tiempo te va a llevar, mejor practicarla previamente ante tu mascota, tu familia o una comunidad.\nA medida que uno le agarra la mano, sabe cuánto va a tardar la charla o concepto, y si es necesario achicarla o estirarla dependiendo del tiempo.\n\nOtra cosa que intentaría evitar es que no haya interacción con la gente.\nEn algún momento, se tiene que interactuar con las personas que asistieron al evento, sea durante la charla, en el final o cuando te sientas más cómoda, pero si solo vas dar la charla, terminas y te retirás, perdés la posibilidad de generar contactos o estar accesible, dos de las cosas que este tipo de eventos tiene como objetivo principal.\n\nCon respecto a los materiales, evitar que no sean accesibles.  Como mencioné antes trabajar para que sean lo más accesible posible (fuentes legibles, tamaños y colores contrastantes, notas del orador, texto alternativo en las imágenes) y que tengan licencia.\n\nCuando hago una charla, dentro del tiempo que me lleva armarla, le agrego uno o dos días más para chequear la accesibilidad.\nLa licencia es fundamental para que sepan cómo pueden reusar tu material y, si no lo pueden reusar, que quede claro.\n\nPor último, una frase muy argentina: “no pararse arriba del caballo”, dar la charla con la tranquilidad que conocés tu trabajo y tu disciplina, pero con la humildad que corresponde. Hay que reconocer que puede haber preguntas que no sepas responder.\n\nLo mismo pasa con el lenguaje, donde se puede ser correcto técnicamente sin utilizar un lenguaje complejo.\nSin embargo, si empleas términos técnicos porque los tenés que usar sí o sí, hay que explicarlos o hacer una analogía con cosas de la vida cotidiana. Por ejemplo, un programa de computación es como una receta: le das instrucciones a la computadora.\nPor eso es clave conocer a tu audiencia, porque podés saber en qué apoyarte al momento de explicar conceptos más complejos.\n\nEstamos hablando de charlas que se dan en eventos comunitarios. En general, yo los doy sin costo y los materiales son abiertos, pero si una empresa te invita, que no te de vergüenza ni miedo cobrar por las mismas en el caso de que eso, después, reditúe económicamente a quien te invita.\n\nYo tampoco hago gastos de mi bolsillo si me invitan a dar una charla; esto significa que los costos de viajes, inscripción, corren por cuenta del organizador. Si tus charlas tienen mucha demanda, el manejo de los costos por parte del organizador, te ayuda a decidir. Asimismo, nunca hay que entregar la propiedad intelectual de tu material a quien haga el evento, pero si te piden que la entregues y vos estás de acuerdo, cobrales muy bien.\n\nEn mi caso, las charlas que doy tienen que ver con Ciencia de Datos, con Agro y con comunidades de práctica.Si me invitan a dar una charla como investigadora de INTA tampoco cobro, porque es parte de mi trabajo.Cuando me invitan a dar una charla por mi trabajo en las comunidades de práctica o no relacionado con INTA, si son de universidades públicas, de grupos como R-Ladies, para eventos y conferencias gratuitos, las hago como una forma de devolver gran parte de lo que recibí.\n\nVivo en un país que me permitió educarme con un sistema que lo mantenemos entre todos, y dar este tipo de capacitaciones es una forma de retribución. Hoy en día, tengo suficiente privilegio como para poder realizar este tipo de actividades sin cobrar; no todo el mundo puede, y tampoco se tienen que sentir obligadas.\n\nHay algunas personas que tienen una guía a la hora de ser invitada a dar una charla, por ejemplo \n\nTatiana Mac, \n\nGreg Wilson y Steph Locke.\n\nEstas también son cuestiones que yo tomo en cuenta, ¿es un panel todo de hombres?, ¿el evento tiene un Código de Conducta?, ¿Es de acceso libre o bien tiene beneficios para personas menos favorecidas?.\nDe nuevo, si uno puede exigir este tipo de cosas en los eventos que va a participar estaremos ayudando a generar ambientes más amigables y seguros.  A veces no se tiene la posibilidad o el privilegio de elegir, quienes podemos, debemos hacerlo.","type":"content","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-4-ten-s-consejos-sobre-cosas-que-hay-que-evitar-o-quiz-s-manejar-con-cuidado","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"5. ¿Qué perspectivas tenés de tus futuras charlas? ¿Qué te interesaría probar?","lvl2":"Personal stories - Presenting outside of your discipline (Español)"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories#id-5-qu-perspectivas-ten-s-de-tus-futuras-charlas-qu-te-interesar-a-probar","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personal stories - Presenting Outside of Your Discipline","lvl3":"5. ¿Qué perspectivas tenés de tus futuras charlas? ¿Qué te interesaría probar?","lvl2":"Personal stories - Presenting outside of your discipline (Español)"},"content":"Últimamente, me piden que haga charlas sobre tres temas: comunidades de práctica, ciencia y datos aplicados al agro (con casos), y ciencias y datos en geotecnología. Es complejo mantener el entusiasmo de contar siempre lo mismo porque, además, uno se siente medio impostor pensando en cuántas veces más va a dar la misma charla. El tema es que, a veces, te invitan porque la vieron y quieren replicarla en otro ámbito.\n\nLo que hago, en general, es ir actualizándolas cuando tengo nuevos resultados o casos de uso y, dependiendo de la audiencia que me dicen que va a haber, ejemplifico en detalle o explico con más detalle los conceptos que necesito que se conozcan para que se aproveche más la charla.\n\nSe puede observar que hay una gran necesidad de parte de la gente por volver a lo presencial.\nYo espero que siga el tema virtual porque se me abrió un panorama de participación (como disertante y como asistente) que no tenía; me permitió llegar a lugares que hubiesen sido imposible si eran presenciales (Ecuador, Bolivia, EE. UU., África) ya que tengo dos hijos chiquitos y evito realizar viajes largos, por lo menos hasta que sean más grandes. Entonces, sin la virtualidad no hubiese podido llegar a tanta gente. Vamos a ver qué ocurre, qué nos depara el futuro. Yo pienso que este año y gran parte del año que viene, vamos a seguir igual, al menos en el sur.\n\nCon respecto a las herramientas para dar cursos y charlas, aplico mucho lo que enseñamos en

preparation time and cover related costs such as accessibility requirements for remote events, or travel and accommodation for in-person events.\nHow much they are offered will vary depending on the organisation (non-profit or private sector), nature of participation (such as short talk, panel discussion or seminar) and also the status of the talk, for example, you might be offered more for being a keynote speaker at a large conference.\nMany academics are never offered or do not accept honoraria payments for many personal (tax, admin overhead in handling small fund, sufficient salary or personal interest in the event) or professional (their organisation policy prohibits the receiving of honoraria or they donate back to the host organisation) reasons.\n\nTo have a diverse and inclusive academic community, we need to be aware that not all researchers can afford to dedicate their time to volunteer/unpaid labour or have the money to cover the cost of giving an invited talk.\nTherefore, organisers should consider offering honoraria, if they have sufficient budget, as developing talks takes a substantial amount of time and effort.\n\nFor more information about giving invited talks see the blog “\n\nSpeaking as an Academic: What to expect when you are invited to share your work”.\nAlso, see \n\nFix the Gap project by ‘\n\n500womenscientists​.org’ that aims to crowdsource speaking engagement fees & honoraria details to empower researchers to ask for compensation.","type":"content","url":"/communication/presentations/presentations-remote#honoraria-for-delivering-a-talk","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Presenting at Remote

Some of the tips have been adapted from ‘Practical tips for scientists using twitter’ \n\nChabrol, 2021.\n\nBut when starting with X it is important to first consider what your purpose for using it is.\nThis will help you develop your voice (how you want to be heard, what topics you focus on, your overall message) on X.\n\n1. Choose a good X handle and write a good bio\n\nAdd a photo, cover image and short bio that is relevant to the research you are doing.\n\nYour bio can be linked to accounts such as your institution using their @, your funding body and common hashtags for your subject.\n\nYou might want to have a specific X account for your project or organisation as well as a personal one.\n\n2. Make lists\n\nThis helps you to follow lots of people and can be used for events.\n\nLists can be made public.\n\n3. Think about your audience for each tweet\n\nIt might be that all your tweets are to target your research community but some may also be for the wider public.\nTherefore, think carefully about the language you use, avoid jargon and subject-specific acronyms, and add links to more information.\n\n4. Add subject-specific hashtags\n\nUnless you’re paying for X Premium you’ll only have 280 characters, so using hashtags to link to different groups of interest is an important way to get your message out there.\n\nTweets with hashtags can increase engagement by almost 100% for individuals.\n\nThere are also regular hashtags for each day of the week, for example, #MondayMotivation or #FridayFeeling.\n\n5. Include some other accounts in your tweet\n\nLinking your tweet to other accounts using @ will mean you get more retweets and therefore will spread your tweet further.\n\nIt is a good idea to find other researchers and organisations that have large X followings.\nThis gives your tweet the largest reach possible.\n\n6. Add visuals\n\nYou can use images and gifs to draw attention to your tweets.\n\nIf you don’t have an image, a link will generate an image so make sure that the link is up to date and has a relevant image for your tweet.\n\nYou also have the option to add a description of the image so that content is accessible to more people.\nHere is a link to the X help page on \n\nhow to make images accessible for people.\n\n7. Don’t start a tweet with ‘@’\n\nThese are treated as replies so become hidden.\n\n8. Be careful with sensitive data\n\nMake sure you are aware of the policy concerning social media in your project or institution.\n\nSome projects will not allow you to tweet about progress until a certain time in the project and others will encourage the use of social media from the start.\n\n9. Take care of yourself\n\nNot all the interactions that you have on X will be pleasant as some people find fun in starting arguments or being offensive towards you.\n\nIt is best not to interact with these people.\n\nYou can follow \n\nCharles’ Rules of Arguments.\nThis sets out that if you receive an argumentative reply, you should state your position once explaining any misunderstandings and then do not reply again.\nLet others come to your defence.\n\nIf it continues, you can block this person and report the abuse.\n\nHere is a link to the X help page about \n\nhow to block accounts.\n\nStarting to use X might involve tweeting about new papers and useful resources in your field, events that you go to such as workshops and conferences, and retweeting other people in your field to highlight their work.\n\nYou might also want to start with a series of intro tweets to introduce yourself, your career so far and your current work.\nYou can pin this to your profile so that it is always what people see first.","type":"content","url":"/communication/social-media/social-media-twitter-tips","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Tips for Starting with X","lvl2":"X

It’s up to you to decide what information is essential.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when writing alt text:\n\nAlt text should be specific and not overly descriptive.\nIt should convey the main point of the image, such as why the image was included or what the author wants the reader to notice\n\nWhile length should depend on the complexity of the content, good descriptions are concise, but describe what’s in your images accurately enough to understand their context and content.\n\nStay clear of repetition.\n\nNever start your alt text with ‘image of’ as this will be obvious to the user.\n\nInclude any essential text or data that is part of the visual.\n\nImages that already have a caption describing the image, may not need additional alt text.\n\nScreen readers will pause and stop when you tell them to but, depending on user settings, might not annunciate exclamation or question marks.\n\nWhile accessibility practices do not need to be justified, it is good to note that Alt text is also used by search engines too, so using alt text may help grow a brand’s visibility online as well as enable greater accessibility.\n\nSource: What’s the alternative?

write and use alt text for your work, please use this \n\nguidance.\n\nLimit embedded links and provide alternatives for accessing information: On many platforms, embedded links may not be accessible by screen readers, or may increase cognitive overload.\nIf you are inserting a link into a message, limit the number of embedded links within a message.\nOn Slack, avoid hyperlinking links within replies to messages when possible, as links posted within threads are not readable for screen readers.\n\nLimit use of emojis that disrupt narrative flow: Do not replace words with emojis or use too many emojis to communicate important information.\nScreen readers usually read one emoji at a time using the alternative text and while sometimes the purpose may be clear (:thumbsup: represents an icon of a thumbs up sign), at other times it may not be (:partyblobcat represents a multicolored cat that is rotating in a circle, and is generally used in the context of a celebration or celebratory news).\nMore broadly, strings of emojis can produce a clunky, repetitive user experience for people trying to understand the core message.\nRemember that not all people are able to access the emoji reactions option within Slack, and normalise using written affirmations as well.\n\nCross-post information to ensure openness: People interact with The Turing Way community on many different platforms.\nNot everyone in the The Turing Way community is in the Slack workspace, or on Github, in every community call, or on every social media channel.\nWhere possible, we aim to normalise creating issues and discussions on the Github repository or post across social media channels in order to ensure the widest reach and participation possible across the community.\n\nBe sensitive to bandwidth needs: As a digital and remote-first project, we are committed to making sure that our resources, communication platforms, and community are accessible to the widest possible audience, despite any bandwidth needs or barriers.\nIn order to make sure that our communication platforms are accessible in low-bandwidth environments for the community, we avoid posting data-intensive content like videos directly into the channels.\nInstead, we prioritise hosting the content on other platforms (such as YouTube) where viewers have the option to adjust the data-intensiveness of the streaming platform.\nWe also frequently turn off video streaming in team meetings in order to adjust for participants or community members that find it difficult to tune in.\n\nBe descriptive and clear in communication: Aside from these concrete recommendations that we adhere to within the community, more broadly we aim to prioritise clear communication within The Turing Way in order to ensure that our messages are accessible and readable for the community.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-comms-platforms#access-and-inclusion-related-support-we-provide-on-communication-platforms","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Access-centered

Barriers may be anything related to, including, and extending beyond the following:\n\nAge\n\nDisability\n\nEthnicity and race\n\nFamily\n\nLanguage (written and/or spoken)\n\nGeography\n\nNationality\n\nReligion, faith and belief\n\nSex and gender\n\nSexual orientation\n\nSocioeconomic status\n\nTechnical or disciplinary background\n\nMental health\n\nDigital barriers (such as connectivity, computational capacity, and design)\n\nWe recognise the complex and interlinking ways in which intersectionality affects identity, and thereby, access or inclusion within any community project like The Turing Way. So in this sense, our accessibility practices may overlap with practices that enable inclusion more broadly within any community.\n\nIn developing this policy, we aim to draw from the \n\naccess-centered framework in describing access as a constant process that changes in each space with each individual. This document is a part of a broader collection of documentation across accessibility, listed below:\n\nAccessibility policy: Our vision and guiding principles for how we practice accessibility.\n\nCommunity Handbook Accessibility Guidelines: Practical advice to build accessibility into your contributions and activity within the community.\n\nAccessibility Guide: A broader discussion of accessibility and access-related practices that extend beyond The Turing Way.\n\nEach resource (this Accessibility Policy, Community Handbook Accessibility Guidelines, and our Accessibility Guide) plays a different yet overlapping role in enabling, documenting, and sharing our evolving language around accessible and inclusive collaboration.\n\nThis policy is a work in progress, as are the practices that we employ as a community. Much like how The Turing Way is always being written and rewritten, our accessibility policies and practices are constantly being updated as broader awareness grows and changes in technology are made.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-policy#accessibility-policy-of-the-turing-way-community","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"1.1 Core Principles","lvl2":"Accessibility Policy of The Turing Way Community"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-policy#id-1-1-core-principles","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl3":"1.1 Core Principles","lvl2":"Accessibility Policy of The Turing Way Community"},"content":"These core principles are at the heart of our accessibility policy, and they extend beyond the web accessibility of our open access guides to our broader practices as a community, expanded upon in Section 2.0.\n\nThis means that questions of access are tied to how people read the guides as well as their ability to participate in the project and the community. Participation in The Turing Way itself can be defined broadly, but doing so often requires navigating a number of different platforms. In all contexts, we aim to facilitate access in a broad sense through:\n\nRemoving barriers: We actively advocate for and employ tactics that seek to remove barriers for any current or future participants in our community. This may include people who have historically been limited or structurally excluded from participating due to any of the barriers listed above.\n\nSharing openly: We aim to draft, write, review, and edit our open access guides using open practices documented in our \n\nguides. We do this in order to enable people from a broad range of backgrounds to get involved in the project.\n\nSupporting inclusive participation: We acknowledge that openness alone does not make a project accessible in a broad sense, and we are committed to maintaining a socio-technical infrastructure that enables inclusive participation more broadly. This includes hosting spaces for contribution, documenting our practices, and actively gathering feedback.\n\nThe practices and policies listed here relate to these three operating principles, which shape how we work within the community to enable access on the web, on our community platforms, and while planning events.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-policy#id-1-1-core-principles","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl4":"2.0 Community Accessibility Practices","lvl3":"1.1 Core Principles","lvl2":"Accessibility Policy of The Turing Way Community"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/community-handbook/accessibility/accessibility-policy#id-2-0-community-accessibility-practices","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"","lvl4":"2.0 Community Accessibility Practices","lvl3":"1.1 Core Principles","lvl2":"Accessibility Policy of The Turing Way Community"},"content":"As an open source community that relies on projects and platforms for our underlying infrastructure, we acknowledge that The Turing Way is limited in what standalone access-centred support we can offer.\n\nWith this being said, we are committed to ensuring greater access to our guides, events, and community platforms through a variety of ways.\n\nEnsuring web accessibility for our open access resources:  Our project is built with \n\nJupyterBook on the \n\nGithub platform, which have initiatives that address their compliance with \n\nW3C WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.\nAs a community documentation project, we aim to use and employ appropriate and relevant \n\nalt text (also known as ‘alternative text’ for all of our images, charts, and data visualisations.\n\nEnabling accessibility of our shared community platforms: Our community is dedicated to enabling access across the various platforms we communicate on, which extends not only to the accessibility practices mentioned above, but also to the language we employ to ensure a broad audience.

collaborative efforts lower the psychological barriers for the new contributors who can propose improvements in the book by editing, moving, and adapting its content as the book grows.\n\nFurthermore, with our commitment to fair acknowledgement in this project, we create opportunities to highlight the work of every contributor without trying to fit The Turing Way into a traditional credit system.\n\nThis is also an opportunity for us to promote a cultural change in the research assessment system to better recognise an individual’s contributions to open science.\nThese contributions

You can ask for your e-mail address or any information to be removed from our database at any time. If you have any questions please contact us by emailing \n\nturingway@gmail.com. You may edit your responses after submission until 21 May 2022. Please select the “I understand and I accept” option before proceeding.\n\nWe ask if applicants have previously participated in a Book Dash so that they can express their interest to join the Book Dash review and planning committee for this event:\n\nWe encourage returning applicants to The Turing Way Book Dash to join the planning committee. They will take on advisory and leading roles for the Book Dash events in 2022 by getting involved in application Review, selection process, organisation meeting, session host and mentorship or accessibility-related support they can offer based on their willingness, availability and interest. For any questions, please email \n\ntheturingway@gmail​.com.\n\nIn 150 words each, applicants respond to the following mandatory questions:\n\nWhat could you contribute to The Turing Way during the book dash event?\n\nWhat would you gain from being part of The Turing Way book dash event?\n\nWe ask an optional question for returning members to express their interest in taking on leadership roles in designing and organising Book Dashes:\n\nHow would you like to collaborate with other participants, or what support will you invite from them during the Book Dash event?\n\nThese responses to the questions in the application form help us select a group of people who will be able to work effectively together and cover a broad set of possible contributions to The Turing Way.\nWe don’t expect that the candidates might have previously contributed to the project, but some familiarity with our project infrastructure such as GitHub-based contributions will be helpful.\nWe are looking to support ideas on what our participants think is important and helpful for others doing reproducible research and data science in the current scenario.\n\nWe then ask a few demographic questions.\nWe want to make sure that the selected group of participants brings multiple skills, knowledge, and experience to The Turing Way.\nWe aim to involve members from diverse groups, especially those who are traditionally excluded from data science based on gender, ethnicity, and career stage.\nTherefore, we ask our applicants to indicate if they consider themselves to be a member of one or multiple historically underrepresented groups.\nHere they can add any other information about themselves that they think the core team should know when reviewing their application.\n\nWe seek to remove any barriers that might prevent our participants from attending the event.\nHence, we use this form to assess what support we can offer, including funding requirements, to our participants in ensuring that they can comfortably attend the event.\nApplicants can mention their travel, accommodation, childcare, and accessibility requirements for their participation.\n\nFinally, we provide details regarding the event schedule and ask our applicants to indicate which time slots for collaborative co-working and social sessions would work for their time zones.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-application#call-for-applications","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Application and Review Process","lvl2":"Reviewing

consider the following questions:\n\nHas the applicant answered the application questions?\n\nDoes the applicant have a clear, feasible, and relevant idea of how they will contribute to the book dash?\tThis scoring corresponds generally to reviews of “not ready”, “enthusiastic” and “clear” respectively:\n\nIs the applicant enthusiastic about reproducibility and the aims of The Turing Way?\n\nBased on their evaluation of the applications they will provide scores for different criteria that will be assessed as follows:\n\nApplicants who score mostly 1s do not have a clear idea/topic ready for contribution or do not have a clear understanding of the overall goals of The Turing Way and book dash in general.\n\nApplicants who score mostly 2s are enthusiastic if not wholly suitable for the project/event, for example, they may come with some ideas for a contribution that is currently not in the scope of the project/event.\n\nApplicants who score mostly 3s are clearly ready, goal-oriented, interested in contributing to the project, and excited to learn from others at the event.\n\nTable summarising our scoring rubric and criteria for each score:\n\nThis scoring rubric is based on the Mozilla Open Leaders and Open Life Science (OLS) selection criteria as described in the ‘Review Rubrics’ on \n\nthis GitHub repository.\n\nSections\n\nScore 1\n\nScore 2\n\nScore 3\n\nReadiness for the book dash event\n\n(not ready) Does not provide enough information or seems to misunderstand the nature of The Turing Way project and this event in general\n\n(enthusiastic) Seems to have a clear understanding of The Turing Way project and this event and brings along a specific content for contributions\n\n(clear) Seems to have a clear understanding of The Turing Way project and this event and a clear understanding of how they can contribute and collaborate with each other at this event\n\nGoals for the project contributions:\n\n(not ready) Shares vague or general ideas that are unrelated to The Turing Way project and this event, or no goals at all\n\n(enthusiastic) Shares clear, overly ambitious ideas for The Turing Way project and this event that can likely be refined in a collaboration cafe, or the day before the event during the brainstorm session\n\n(clear) Shares clear, achievable contribution/development ideas for this event that fits The Turing Way project and are likely to be achieved through the applicant’s participation\n\nPurpose of participation and what they will get out of the book dash:\n\n(not ready) Purposes for participation at the book dash seem almost entirely self-centered and about the applicant’s status, rather than about participating in The Turing Way community to develop the project\n\n(enthusiastic) Purposes for the participation at the book dash event are not completely clear from the application or are limited (even though useful), such as typo or bug fixing\n\n(clear) Purposes for participation at the book dash event are valuable in many ways and are likely to help the applicant to become an active contributor and take ownership of their work in The Turing Way project and in the broader ecosystem in their own rights\n\nWillingness to collaborate and contribute after the book dash:\n\n(not ready) Seems closed to collaborative ways of working or more interested in only one aspect of data science, research or related topic\n\n(enthusiastic) Seems excited to learn from others and The Turing Way project, but in a general way without much understanding of what those things mean yet\n\n(clear) Seems excited to collaborate with others and is motivated to contribute to The Turing Way community\n\nThe following sections are aimed at collecting open-ended response by the reviewers:\n\nWe ask all reviewers to finish the review by describing the application, representation aspects of the applicant and the motivations for their scores to facilitate conversation during the selection panel discussion under these questions.- Please highlight any diversity/minority groups this applicant belong to, that should be represented at this event\n- Please provide 1-2 summary sentences about this application to facilitate discussion during the selection panel\n\nReviewers are also asked to disclose if any conflict of interest may have influenced their review leading to any bias in their decision.- Please state if you have any conflict of interest with the proposal described in this application or do you know this applicant personally that may lead to a biased decision\n\nFinally, reviewers are asked whether they would recommend an applicant.\nThe available answers are “No”, “Yes”, “Unsure” or “Request for open discussion in the panel”.\nCandidates who have ratings of “No” or “Unsure” across all reviewers will be rejected.\nAll other candidates will be discussed at the panel selection.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-application#ch-bookdash-application-rubrics","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Book Dash Event

Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\n\nDo not harass people. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\n\nRespect the privacy and safety of others. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participants’ personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (“doxing”) is a form of harassment.\n\nBe considerate of others’ participation. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\n\nDon’t be a bystander. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up.

You can join using the \n\nthis link\n\nSlack is one of our core communication channels within the The Turing Way community. It is a space where folks ask questions, learn about each other’s work, and get involved with The Turing Way and other projects. While it is not the only communication channel used by the community, it is a popular platform, increasingly used by remote teams around the world.\n\nHere is a short guide to the default slack channels (meaning, you’ve already been added to them when you joined this space!):\n\n#announcements: Ping you about recurring community calls and community events (feel free to mute!)\n\n#ask-away: Use this channel to ask any question you might have - general or specific, and we’ll make sure to redirect you to the right resources\n\n#community: Topics related to the community, celebrations, collaborations, and other projects\n\n#general: For general-purpose conversations & questions\n\n​#github​-related​-posts: For chapter ideas and discussions, as well as ongoing projects within the github repository.\n\n​#ideas​-for​-discussion: For discussion and ideas, related to the guides & otherwise\n\n#introductions: Feel free to introduce yourself here!\n\n#random: For all other questions, comments not related to The Turing Way\n\n#welcome: A bot is installed in this channel, that tags you with a random greeting & flag to represent our global community :sparkles:\n\nThere are also a number of channels dedicated to specific types of work and questions within the community (all are welcome!):\n\n#accessibility: Join for discussions around accessibility practices within the community, and the upcoming work of a new working group\n\n​#environmental​-sustainability: Join for discussions about environmental sustainability, co-hosted with the Environmental Data Science Book.\n\n#translation: Join to learn about all things translation & localisation, as well as ongoing meetings and projects within the team\n\n#infrastructure: Learn more about project architecture, and get involved with technical infrastructure aspects of the project\n\n​#reviewers​-editors​-wg: Learn more about how to review & edit ongoing writing projects within The Turing Way\n\n​#trainers​-mentors​-wg: Help to review ongoing promotion materials, and learn how how you can mentor other community members\n\n#user-experience: Join the ongoing efforts around user experience and design within the community.\n\nYou might also be interested in joining the following channels:\n\n#en-español: Para hispanohablantes en la comunidad\n\n#events: for upcoming events in the open science network\n\n​#jobs​-and​-opportunities: for jobs, workshops, and other related opportunities\n\n​#reading​-recommendations: For reading recommendations from community members\n\n​#research​-data​-management: For folks with an interest in research data management skills, practices, and tools.\n\nWe also have Slack channels dedicated to each guide:\n\n​#guide​-for​-collaboration\n\n​#guide​-for​-communication\n\n#guide-for-ethics\n\n​#guide​-for​-project​-design\n\n​#guide​-for​-reproducibility\n\nIf there are any other channels you’d like to see in the workspace, or ones that we use that you don’t see listed here – please feel free to correct this page by making an issue or pull request on Github.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/communication-channels/slack-welcome-guide#welcome-to-the-turing-way-slack","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Welcome to The Turing Way Slack!","lvl2":"Best Practices for using Slack"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/community-handbook/communication-channels/slack-welcome-guide#best-practices-for-using-slack","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Welcome to The Turing Way Slack!","lvl2":"Best Practices for using Slack"},"content":"As with all of our communication channels, The Turing Way slack abides by our \n\nCode of Conduct.\n\nWe are in the process of developing platform-specific guidelines for Slack and other community platforms. While these are being developed, here are a few general guidelines to get you started:\n\nImages: Use alt text to describe images, diagrams, or other visuals (\n\nLearn more about how to do this in this tutorial.). Don’t forget to add important information like context in your description!\n\nLinks: If you are inserting a link into a message, limit the number of embedded links within a message. Avoid embedding links within replies to messages when possible, as links posted within threads are not readable for screen readers.\n\nEmojis: Limit the use of emojis that break up narrative flows of information where possible (such as emojis listed between works). Remember that not all people are able to access the emoji reactions option within Slack, and use written affirmations as well!\n\nBandwidth: In order to make sure that Slack is accessible in low-bandwidth environments for the community, avoid posting data-intensive content like videos directly into the channels. Instead, prioritise hosting the content on other platforms (such as YouTube), and sharing the link.\n\nOpenness: Remember that not everyone in the The Turing Way community is in the Slack workspace – or on every social media channel. Where possible – especially when discussing chapter ideas and other collaborations – create issues and discussions on the Github repository or post across social media channels, in order to ensure the widest reach and participation possible.\n\nIn general, we encourage an approach to Slack that is as accessible as possible, for as many people as possible. Please practice kindness when you communicate with others, and be mindful of cultural, linguistic, disability, and individual differences that may affect how people communicate online.\n\nIs there anything we are missing?

They are also, for the most part, unpaid to contribute to this open source project.\n\nTo bring the community together, The Turing Way has a variety of different community calls organised throughout the year. These calls may vary from collaboration and working calls to organisational meetings, to public share-outs that demonstrate transparency, to a mixture of all of the above. Due to the international nature of the project, these calls are generally organised online using a platform such as Zoom.\n\nOn each page of this subchapter, you can learn more about each type of community call, which are roughly organised into four types: community coworking calls, organising and governance calls, onboarding and welcoming calls, and public celebration calls.\n\nIt is important to note that not all of our community calls fit neatly into one category over another. Some may mix practices and purposes (for example coworking as well as celebrations), while others may have a specific purpose (such as decision-making).\nAll are meant to demonstrate our principles of being an open and transparent community.\n\nBecause of their scope and size, the \n\nBook Dash and \n\nFireside Chat series are documented separately.\nHowever, those calls overlap with many of the principles and practices shared in this community call chapter.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Turing Way Community Calls","lvl2":"1.

This process will be detailed more fully in another chapter within the Community Handbook.\n\nThe first two core team meetings in June 2022 and September 2022 focused on the formalisation of the team as the “Core Team” of The Turing Way.\n\nIn June 2022, the types of work being formalised within the project was related to Translation and Localisation (which had begun in prior years). Simultaneously, the Turing’s TPS team had also expanded significantly with Research Application Manager (RAM), Research Community Manager (RCM), and Research Project/Programme Managers (RPMs) roles whose contributions to the project were not clear, though written into their job descriptions. At this call, the proposal was made to trial working groups within the project under three themes: authors & reviewers, infrastructure maintainers, and trainers and mentors – formalising streams of work that already existed in the project, following the translation and localisation process. This call announced a trial, and a call for volunteers from the existing core team to iterate on the format in the following months.\n\nThese three working groups were incubated and began to meet and self-organise in the following months. In September 2022, the second “core team” meeting was organised to receive feedback from participants about the process of organising formally as working groups, as opposed to informally as different initiatives. \n\nFeedback was collected about the process of working groups at this call, identifying the need for personnel and organisational support, as well as projects (such as transition from github repository to organisation, website and url, and other needs).\n\nAt the January and March 2023 core team calls, drafts were shared about the status of governance within the project – documenting the status of the incubated working groups. Around this time, work around accessibility began to formalise within the project. The “reviers and editors” and “trainers and mentors” working groups were retired, while the “infrastructure maintainers” (which became the Infrastructure WG) continued. We also created our \n\nfirst internal annual report which was shared during this call.\n\nAt the June 2023 core team meeting, further formalisation was done. An “accessibility working group” had solidified in the previous months (April 2023), in partnership and with volunteers from Metadocencia, while the “infrastructure” and “translation and localisation” working groups continued to consolidate their work. The Infrastructure Working Group lead on the transition to a Github organisation, which was completed in August 2023. The Translation and Localisation team were particularly supported to give talks that centered their work during this time.\n\nAt the September 2023 core team meeting, feedback was shared explicitely about decision-making within the project, sharing feedback about which decisions were blocked and/or needed support from project leadership, the delivery team, and/or operational support from the project RCM or RPM.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-core-team#evolution-of-call","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Core Team Meetings","lvl2":"Evolution of format of call"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-core-team#evolution-of-format-of-call","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Core Team Meetings","lvl2":"Evolution of format of call"},"content":"During the period of organising core team calls, the format was iterated on a few times.

While these two persona types (employee of the Alan Turing Institute and volunteer contributors to TTW) were broad, their needs and dynamics were different due to team and line management responsibilities. This lead to questions like:\n\n(For ATI employees): Do volunteers engage with the core team meeting as representing their role, or as a representative of their team? How did line management affect this responsibility?\n\n(For volunteers): How\n\n(For both): What was the “responsibility” of a core team member of The Turing Way?\n\nThe lack of clarity on “who” was a part of the core team begged the question of who was accountable for facilitating contributions or contributing directly to The Turing Way project. This “core team” call – in trying to address the needs of both of these groups, created a deadlock in decision-making and reinforced power dynamics within the project.\n\nThe purpose of call evolved over time.\n\nThese calls were initiated as a process of formalisation within The Turing Way community. Even the act of gathering diverse participants from the project was initially identified as a need within the project.\n\nAs the community continued to grow significantly throughout 2022 and 2023 with new work packages and projects, the core team of the project that met at these calls grew alongside this, as did the need to address blocks for decision-making within the community. To address this, the Core Team Meetings evolved into a place for receiving feedback from across a wide range of community leadership within the project. Facilitated written exercises and verbal discussions during these calls enabled the gathering of this feedback.\n\nFurthermore, this call, while it assembled community leaders from across the project, was also identified to be a closed space. The call was not open to observers from the wider community as well as to others from aligned communities. In other words, the call was closed to the “core team” from the beginning, and the next stage of the project required a more open forum where feedback and observation from the broader community and from aligned communities could be made possible.\n\nThe current reformatted call centres an open “community forum”-style call over the format of “closed core team meeting” space.\n\nThe feedback received during the calls needed different meeting infrastructure to act upon it.\n\nWhile these themes have been present throughout the entire process of organising the Core Team Meetings, during the two final Core Team Meetings in June and September 2023 in particular, the feedback received demonstrated strong needs for clarity regarding institutional support, decision-making, institutional association, staff capacity, funding, and more.\n\nBecause the feedback shared in both meetings demonstrated their urgency (and in many ways, repeated the same feedback in different forms), this reinforced the need to transition this space into another format in 2024 and required The Turing Way core delivery team to take different actions.\n\nThis informed what is currently ongoing documentation that aims to clarify the relationship between the Alan Turing Institute and The Turing Way project, Working Group needs and “how-to” guides, and the “Three-levels of decision-making” within the project.\n\nThe transition of the “Core Team Meeting” into a broader “Open Governance Forum/Call” has allowed for the development of possible “solutions” or documented much-needed clarifications for recurring questions within the project.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-core-team#reasons-for-retiring","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Drop-in Sessions"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-coworking-dropins","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Drop-in Sessions"},"content":"Drop-in sessions are an informal collaboration format where a team or group of people, such as Working Groups in The Turing Way, host regular opportunities for other people within the community or organisation to ask questions or start a conversation on a topic of their interest.\n\nThese sessions generally include an online component, typically using \n\nZoom.\nThe format and sign up method will depend on the needs and preferences of the organising team and the target community the sessions are designed for.\n\nThe primary goal of these sessions is to provide an opportunity for answering targeted questions on a subject that the team holds expertise in, such as data protection, stakeholder engagement, or research software engineering.\nThe sessions are a resource for community or organisation members to ask questions, receive targeted advice and support, and create space to start co-working or further collaboration.\nThe sessions are also an opportunity to learn about and connect with new teams and individuals that an attendee may not regularly connect with.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

and communities.\n\nThe practices described here are what we use in The Turing Way, but there are more ways to run such coworking calls.\nBelow, we describe different aspects that you should take into consideration when planning or designing your coworking calls.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-coworking-organisation","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls for your

Calls for your Community","lvl2":"Designing a format that works for you"},"content":"To identify what could be the best format for your coworking calls, you need to think about the following aspects:\n\nPurpose of your coworking calls\n\nIn The Turing Way, as described in the \n\nmotivation subchapter, we host these calls for building connections, supporting our contributors, onboarding new members and celebrating their work.\n\nYour purpose for hosting coworking calls could be completely different and identifying that is important for you to plan the remaining logistics.\nA few other scenarios could be:\n\nIf you work from home, you would like to see your colleagues and stay connected with them through designated coworking schedules.\n\nIf you are working with a distributed group of people on a common project, and if communication and exchange related to the project while working asynchronously is an issue, you can get a lot of your work done over a coworking call.\n\nIf you are working on multiple projects and struggle to focus on one task at a time, coworking can help you put aside a few hours of your time to work with your colleagues who you share the project with.\n\nIf there is a task you are struggling to complete, you can invite support from your trusted colleagues through coworking calls.\n\nTarget audience\n\nIf you already know the purpose of your coworking calls, you will be able to identify who your target audience is.\n\nFor example, if you host your coworking calls for an open source project such as The Turing Way, you can expect your current members, past contributors or even new members to the project to participate.\nIf you are part of a small project, you would expect the same familiar faces in all your coworking calls.\n\nOrganisers and hosts\n\nMany tasks go into organising a coworking call (discussed later).\nThese tasks can be taken care of by one person like a community manager, project manager, or a volunteer organiser.\nHowever, it is always a good idea to involve more people as co-organisers so that the coworking call still happens even when the main organiser can’t join for any reason.\nTo avoid one person burdening themselves with “not so exciting” organisation issues, you can also decide to rotate the role within the members of your project.\n\nSize of the call\n\nNo matter what the purpose and who the target audience of your calls are, you can decide the size of your call by managing participation by prior registration.\nIf you organise these calls for your project members on a mutually agreed time and with an agenda to work on specific tasks, you can expect most of them to show up.\nIf you keep your call open for any of your community members to join, you may end up having a different number of participants on different calls.\nThis would also mean that for some calls, there won’t be anyone available to co-work with you.\n\nIt’s useful to handle some sort of sign-up sheet or registration system so the organisers know who to expect on the call.\nIn The Turing Way, we use dedicated HackMD notes that can be updated before each call by the participants.\n\nFrequency of these calls\n\nOnce you have identified the purpose, target audience and size of your calls, you can decide how often you would like to host them.\nIf you work with the same group of people, you can host it as per your common availability and a mutually agreed time on a weekly or monthly basis.\n\nIf the expected participants of your call also work on multiple projects, you might consider regularly hosting it on the same day and time each week or each month.\nThis consistency will allow them to check their availability in advance and block these hours in their calendar.\nThis will also reduce the extra work of coordinating the common availability every time (though you will have to do this in the beginning).\n\nResource availability\n\nBased on the resources available to you, you might have to fine-tune other aspects of your call.\nFor example:\n\nShared calendar: If there is a calendar that is updated with the coworking calls schedule, people can subscribe to them and indicate their availability.\n\nCommunication platforms: software like Zoom can allow you to connect with many people at the same time. However, you will need a paid subscription (pro account) to control who joins your call (by activating waiting room to avoid Zoom bombing), manage breakout rooms (to allow multiple small groups and discussions) or host longer calls (>40 minutes).\n\nChat system: If you have a group Slack or Gitter channel, information can be exchanged with everyone, including those who can not join the calls but want to offer suggestions or carry out related tasks asynchronously but in coordination with the group.\nThis also allows people to keep each other informed of any last-minute changes such as updated links for joining calls, correct notes, or cancellation of calls.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-coworking-organisation#designing-a-format-that-works-for-you","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls for your Community","lvl2":"Logistics and tasks"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-coworking-organisation#logistics-and-tasks","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls for your Community","lvl2":"Logistics and tasks"},"content":"Like any event, coworking calls requires planning, organising, hosting and making sure that they happen.\nAs the organisers of the event, you will be required to:\n\n1. Choose the tools\n\nThe following aspects will require you to make choices in regards of what tools you will use.\n\nmaintaining shared notes: a few options are \n\nEtherpad, \n\nHackMD, \n\nGitHub, \n\nGoogle doc\n\nmanaging registration: a few options are via shared notes, \n\nZoom, \n\nEventbrite, \n\nGoogle Form\n\nhosting the calls: a few options are \n\nZoom, \n\nGoogle Hangout, \n\nSkype, \n\nJitsi\n\nfacilitating chats: a few options are \n\nSlack, \n\nGitter, other \n\nweb-based or phone applications\n\nsharing timers: a few options are \n\ncuckoo.team, \n\nvclock or other web-based timers\n\nfinding a common availability: a few options are \n\nDoodle, \n\nwhen2meet.com, or other \n\nmeeting schedule apps\n\n2. Plan and host the calls\n\nAs discussed earlier, you will need to agree upon dates and a time with people who would like to participate in coworking calls.\nYour calls could be organised on a weekly or monthly basis that consistently take place on a certain day and time periodically, or it could be organised once in a while by finding a common availability.\n\nOnce you have found a schedule (date, time and frequency), the following tasks will go into planning them:\n\nupdate the schedule, agenda and calendar to share them with the attendees (or potential target audience). It is also quite effective when they receive a calendar invite.\n\nmaintain communication (by email, newsletter, or social media) so that everyone is aware of the next calls and the resources available for them to participate.\nIt is particularly crucial to use meeting links like \n\narewemeetingyet for communicating these schedules for members from different countries so that they can see the time in their time zones.\n\nFor hosting these calls, you can reuse and adapt the agenda, techniques and templates described in the earlier chapters.\nYour main tasks as a host will be to:\n\nprovide adequate support to the participants so that they can make the best of their time.\nIn The Turing Way coworking calls, we find it useful to use breakout rooms when there are many people working in small groups or if some people need more discussions, while others want to quietly work on their tasks.\n\nfacilitate shared notes with participants before, during and after the call, so that they can keep track of useful resources or ideas they discuss during the coworking call.\n\n3. Create a safe and accountable space\n\nThough discussed last, this should be your highest priority.\n\nYou should design these calls with the intention to make everyone feel welcome, involved and safe.\nIt’s highly recommended to choose a Code of Conduct and put reporting guideline in place to share with everyone in advance.\nSee this minimal \n\nCoC from Contributor Covenant and an expanded version of \n\nThe Turing Way CoC.\nAdditionally, you should also communicate the basic etiquettes, such as muting microphones when not speaking or not interrupting others when working in a Pomodoro session unless necessary.\n\nIt is useful to let everyone know who they can contact if they need help in troubleshooting during the call or need more time to discuss their ideas.\nCreate an agenda that states clearly what is expected of them, such as if they should bring their tasks and questions to the call or communicate them beforehand.\nIn The Turing Way, we have dedicated slots for both group discussions and quiet working.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-coworking-organisation#logistics-and-tasks","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Organising Coworking Calls for

chapter, Naomi described their 1:1 call format in contrast with The Turing Way group format as follows:\n\nIn the co-working calls I have, it’s 1:1 and we often spend 20 minutes in the beginning catching up and talking about our progress since last time.\nIf there is something we want to discuss more intensely, we allocate 30 minutes of our call time to that, for example, one of us asking the other how to troubleshoot something.\nFor the time in between, we do a few quiet working sessions (sometimes 25 minutes, sometimes longer).\nThis is likely a combination of a co-mentoring call and a co-working Pomodoro call, and it works well for me.\n\nYou can read an adapted version of their blog post along with other ideas for virtual events in the document by Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement \n\nWoodley et al., 2020.\n\nIf you organise or host a coworking call in your community, you are welcome to highlight them in this chapter by creating a \n\npull

Delivery Team hosted a regular meeting for the members working at the Maintenance Level under the title \n\nCore Community Meetings with 30 people working across different Working Groups.\nThese meetings, although not open to the broader community, discussed community-wide projects and reported updates broadly via our newsletters.\n\nAs the community has grown, decision-making processes and structures have also needed different levels of formalisation and transparency, which is why instead of closed meetings, we opted for regular community-wide Community Forums starting in 2024.\nModelled off a political town hall event, these online sessions are an opportunity to better understand activities across the project and how decisions are made.\nOur aim is to leverage the expertise across our community in reviewing our processes and recommend improvements.\nThese calls are a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.\nCommunity Forums are also used for getting new or returning community members informed, and actively involve them in discussing governance processes within The Turing Way.\n\nIn 2025, Steering Committee Meetings, drawing chairs of Working Groups and representatives from projects carried out in collaboration with The Turing Way will be hosted to formalise Constitution Level governance.\n\nThese calls utilise a more traditional meeting format, with prepared agenda items and particular issues to be voted on by different members.\nThese calls also facilitate decision-making in a more decentralised format, such as by inviting feedback asynchronously via GitHub issues/discussions from the organising body of an initiative (such as Working Group,

for Coworking Calls","lvl2":"Motivation and background"},"content":"When The Turing Way started with around 10 members located in the United Kingdom, they could work in real-time and often together in the same location.\nThey shared ideas, helped each other out, got huge amounts of writing, editing and reviewing done, and had lots of fun interacting with each other.\n\nTo help the community of contributors grow beyond the core team, the in-person Book Dash (a shorter version of \n\nbook sprints) were hosted to offer interested participants a similar collaborative environment with an advantage to connect with each other informally.\nHowever, not everyone can join such in-person events.\nThese only work for people who can take 1-2 full days from their job-related and personal responsibilities to attend the event.\nMoreover, they take a lot of time and effort in organisation and are expensive to run, especially if we want to host them frequently to allow more and more participants to experience the joy of working together.\n\nThis is where the practice of online coworking is extremely valuable for The Turing Way as a community project.\n\nThe motivations behind hosting these online calls for The Turing Way community are the following:\n\nOnboard members who are new to the project by providing a real-time orientation\n\nBuild personal connections between members of the community\n\nSupport contributors as they edit, review, design and write content for the book\n\nCreate a sense of accountability and ownership for the goals our members want to accomplish in the project\n\nCelebrate the progress of The Turing Way and collaboratively build consensus on the next steps and future directions.\n\nWe aim to create a safe space for shared experience, connection, support and collaboration for the distributed community of The Turing Way.\n\nIf you want to attend these calls but don’t know what to work on, don’t worry!\nThe Turing Way core team members will be on the call and point you to some starting points in the project and other ongoing efforts where you can make a difference.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-motivation#motivation-and-background","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Motivations, Background, and

\n\nmethod divides the writing process into eight steps: ideation, structuring, drafting, editing, restructuring and revising, polishing, publishing, and promoting.\nThey encourage their participants to identify what they want to write and where they are in this eight-step process.\nOnce they identify their starting point and commit to getting through the next steps by practicing consistency steadily to “The End”.\n\nThey explain that the Shut up & Write! events provide two things:\n\n1. Accountability & Habit Formation:\n\nA new habit becomes a part of our routine when we commit to doing them consistently on a specific day, time, and location.\nBased on this principle, Shut up & Write events allow participants to yield successful outcomes for their writing assignments by making the commitment to attend the writing event each week at the same time for 1 hour.\n\n2. Social Motivation & Support:\n\nThe sense of belonging can increase performance and engagement in tasks.\nIn a survey conducted on 2000 participants from different sectors, high belonging was linked to a whopping 56% increase in job performance \n\nCarr et al., 2019.\nAlong the same line, Shut Up & Write events provide a sense of community where attendees feel supported and motivated by everyone else writing around them.\n\nThey create a cycle of 3 experiences: “habit building and progress”, “social support and accountability” and “great writing experience”, which keep people engaged, feel committed and accomplish what they set out to do.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-motivation#shut-up-write","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Motivations, Background, and Techniques for Coworking Calls","lvl3":"Pomodoro Technique","lvl2":"Techniques"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-motivation#pomodoro-technique","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Motivations, Background, and Techniques for Coworking Calls","lvl3":"Pomodoro Technique","lvl2":"Techniques"},"content":"The \n\nPomodoro Technique uses a timer to break down work into smaller intervals usually of 25 minutes called “Pomodoros”, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes.\nLike the previous technique, the Pomodoro Technique allows planning, tracking, recording, processing and visualizing the task at hand.\n\nPomodoro, from the Italian word for ‘tomato’, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Francesco Cirillo used as a university student. \n\nCummings, 2020\n\nThe goal of this technique is to avoid procrastinating and get things done with the help of the following workflow:\n\nidentify the task\n\nset the Pomodoro timer (25 minutes long)\n\nwork on the task until the timer rings\n\ntake a 5 minute break\n\nidentify what would you work on next\n\nrestart the timer and repeat the workflow\n\nThe original method recommends putting a checkmark on a piece of paper to count the number of Pomodoros and suggests taking a longer break of 15-30 minutes after four Pomodoros.\nThe longer breaks can be used for the following tasks:\n\nReflect on the work that you could get done in the last Pomodoros\n\nReflect on what you learned and what you would do differently going forward\n\nIdentify the next set of tasks or the next steps in the project you are working on\n\nIn the next subchapters, we explain our coworking call formats where we combine these two techniques to host the biweekly Collaboration Cafes and weekly coworking calls for our community members.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-motivation#pomodoro-technique","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Office Hours"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-office-hours","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Office Hours"},"content":"Note\n\nWhile these calls have been retired as of March 2023 (in favor of pre-organised onboarding calls), this documentation has been added for archival and transparency purposes.\n\nOffice hours were a pilot community call that was trialed from Sept 2022 to March 2023.\n\nThis meeting space was trialled after the need was established to create a space where newcomers to the project could learn more about the community (before joining a collaboration cafe or coworking call - two other types of community calls within The Turing Way community). Two hour slots were scheduled weekly on Friday afternoons (UK time), which were advertised as spaces that community members or newcomers could attend to learn more about the project or ask any question they might have.\n\nThis space was created as an informal space to ask questions about the project, join other beginnings in the project, or as a space for informal coffee chats. They were modeled to be one-on-one online help sessions to directly help new community members as they learn more about The Turing Way project. No booking or prior planning was required, and no attendence was tracked to ensure psychological safety and informality of the call.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, these calls were hosted by The Turing Way Community Manager, Anne Lee Steele.\n\nSimilar to other community calls in 2023, the information for this call was hosted on HackMD: \n\nhttps://hackmd.io/","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-office-hours","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Office Hours","lvl2":"About “office” or “drop-in” hours"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/community-handbook/community-calls/community-calls-office-hours#about-office-or-drop-in-hours","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Office Hours","lvl2":"About “office” or “drop-in” hours"},"content":"Many academic institutions host office hours or drop-in hours to help students in a one-on-one learning environment.

While the calls were advertised across the Slack workspace and social media websites, there was usually no more than one attendee in each office hour, with some office hours not being attended by any community member at all. In these cases, the space was re-organised for meetings  (or alternatively: the space was re-organsed)\n\nUnclear purpose: Existing documentation around office hours and/or drop-in hours suggest that such calls are usually better attended if there is a clear purpose for attendence, such as a specific question (see: \n\nThink Student, \n\nSmall Pond Science).

For example:\n> This is my legendary quote. will appear as:\n\nThis is my legendary quote.\n\nHeader and styling: The newsletter title is the top header.\n\nDifferent sections as suggested in the newsletters are second-level headers and the sub-sections are third-level headers.\n\nUse bold letters, italics, hyperlinked texts and quotations wherever applicable\n\nThe project name, The Turing Way, should be italicised.\n\nUse line breaks for each line consistent with The Turing Way writing format.\n\nLeave at least one line space after each section and subsection.\n\nLanguage and tone: Keep the overall language simple and jargon-free, see \n\nThe Turing Way style guide for reference.\n\nThe tone should be welcoming, friendly and preferably informal.\nThis can be personal to the author’s writing style.\n\nAsk more than one person to review your draft to make sure that its content is easy to understand and written clearly.\n\nIf using content from a language or culture different from your own, ask people with that language or culture to review your draft to make sure that the content is not misrepresented.\n\nUse of emojis: It is encouraged to use emoji (show your personality) 😇, but keep it simple, neutral and positive.\n\nBe aware that ambiguous emojis can be misinterpreted by different readers.\n\nWhen in doubt, ask someone to review your draft.\n\nUse of images: Only use relevant images linked to the news item in the newsletter.\n\nMake sure that the images are available under a CC-BY license or approved to be reused by the owners.\n\nAvoid using memes, images with political or sexual innuendo, or anything that is not directly related to the community.\n\nWhen drafting the newsletter in a HackMD, drag-n-drop an image into the editor or copy-paste an image to automatically upload the image to \n\nImgur.\n\nWhen drafting the newsletter on GitHub, upload the images in the folder the-turing-way/communications/newsletters/.\n\nThe file naming convention for images is short-name-monthYYYY.png, where the short-name should be replaced with the identifiable short name of the image, the month should be replaced by the short name of the month and YYYY should be replaced by the year.\n\nFile extension can be .jpg, .png or others with compatible image file types.\n\nUse Markdown syntax to link the images in the newsletter: ![](image/path).\n\nAs suggested in \n\nThe Turing Way style guide, create an alt text for the image: ![Alt: Description of the image - this is not the title but actual explanation of the image](image/path)\n\nBelow the image, write a short descriptive title for the image followed by an empty line.\nLink the title to the source such as a tweet or related event.\n\nWhen using multiple images as panels in one collective image, number each image clearly (this can be done in any photo or text editor) and provide a numbered title for each image.\nSee an example \n\nhere.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/newsletters/newsletters-style","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Template for Drafting Newsletters"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/community-handbook/newsletters/newsletters-template","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Template for Drafting Newsletters"},"content":"(ch-newsltters-template)","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/newsletters/newsletters-template","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Template for Drafting Newsletters"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/community-handbook/newsletters/newsletters-template#template-for-drafting-newsletters","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Template for Drafting Newsletters"},"content":"The template outlined below is what we have been using as a guide for collecting news items for The Turing Way newsletters since September 2019.\nThis template has evolved over several months and in no way claims to be the ‘perfect’ format.\nWhen reusing this template, you should experiment with what works for your community.\nYour suggestions in the earlier subchapters are very welcome.Date: DD Month YYYY\n\n# title\n\nHello Turing Way friends!\n\nThis month ...\n\nShout out ...\n\nEvents ...\n\nFind more details on these topics below 👇\n\n\n## Community meetings\n\n    <About events like Collaboration Café, book dash, other meetings>\n\n## News from the community\n\n    <Any news from the team, community members, and new chapters>\n\n## Relevant resources\n\n    <Any useful resources like relevant publication, training items, and materials from collaborators>\n\n## Tips & Tricks for new contributors\n\n    <Any material that helps the new contributor to relate to the project like impact statement, story, and contributor in focus>\n\n## Acknowledgments and celebrations\n\n    <Shout out and wishes to celebratory news from members, recent meetings where someone talked about Turing Way, Tweets and other online mentions from people other than the team members>\n\n## Special mentions\n\n    <Shout out to the reviewers for this newsletter other than the team members>\n\n## Connect with us!\n\n- [About the project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science)\n- [_The Turing Way_ book](https://book.the-turing-way.org)\n- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way)\n- [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-2v7euwuo7-BYstHdKuTNd1ce0puDtBxA)\n- [Public Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/the-turing-way/the-turing-way)\n- [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA)\n- [X (formerly Twitter) Channel](https://twitter.com/turingway)\n\nYou are welcome to contribute content for the next newsletter by\nemailing [Malvika Sharan](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).\n\n*Did you miss the last newsletters?*\n*Check them out [here](https://buttondown.com/turingway/archive).*","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/newsletters/newsletters-template#template-for-drafting-newsletters","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Onboarding and Offboarding"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/community-handbook/onboarding-offboarding","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Onboarding and Offboarding"},"content":"As a project, our goal is to provide individuals and organizations in academia, industry, government, and the public sectors the information they need to ensure that their projects are easy to reproduce and reuse.\n\nWe encourage all stakeholders in data science to utilise The Turing Way to understand their roles and responsibilities for reproducibility.\n\nThese onboarding and offboarding documents are living documents – as is The Turing Way itself.\n\nAs you will learn from being in this community: this is a constantly-evolving project that holds \n\nemergence as a core value.

different sections in a subchapter we recommend extending the label name with another placeholder.\nThis can be chosen by the authors, which should be a short yet sensible name for the section where the label is being created.\nFor example, rr-overview-resources-addmaterial is a label in the guide “Reproducible Research” (rr) for the subchapter “Resources” for the “Overview” chapter (overview-resources) for the section for “Additional Materials” (addmaterial).\nThis label can be created in the corresponding file for the suggested section name using the following

written in \n\nMarkdown where possible, sometimes, HTML syntax may be necessary to format your contribution the way you desire.\nAlready, Jupyter Book converts Markdown syntax to HTML, making it possible to have a web version of The Turing Way book.\nAs a result, writing your own custom HTML may introduce some variation in the way your new content appears online compared to the rest of the book.\n\nTo minimise this disparity, The Turing Way maintains book-wide \n\nstylesheets that control the look and feel of the book’s content.\nWhen including HTML in your contributions, please refer to these stylesheets and add the relevant classes and IDs defined there to your HTML elements.\nThis ensures that your new content fits the overall style of The Turing Way book.\n\nIn this subchapter, we provide an explanation of how to leverage the book’s stylesheets to style your contributions in sample use-cases.\nIf you want to improve the style of the book, this subchapter also provides a

generates.\n\nBefore writing any CSS, inspect the book’s HTML source code first.\nThis gives you an idea of what elements to target, and may help you figure out how to structure your CSS rules.\n\nAll web browsers allow you to view the source code of websites easily.\nOn computers running the Windows OS or Linux, this is done using CTRL + U.\nFor computers running Mac OS, this is done using Option + Command + U.\n\nOnce you have determined the element(s) you want to modify, write your CSS in The Turing Way’s \n\nstylesheet file.\nIf, for example, you wanted to change the font-family of the paragraph text across the entire The Turing Way book, then you could add the following CSS rule to the stylesheets which target\nall elements with a <p> tag:p {\n    font-family: georgia, garamond, serif;\n}\n\nIf you think that the styling introduced in The Turing way can be useful for other Jupyter Book users, please consider making an upstream contribution to the project by creating a new GitHub issue and starting a discussion with their maintainers:

only to bring The Turing Way to your language, but also to review and improve its content and make it more accessible and localisable for everyone.\n\nIf you run into alt text (which should be translated) that is incomplete, too short, or doesn’t correspond to the content it’s referring to, please create an Issue so we can address it.\n\nSome sections of the The Turing Way may be written in a way that makes it difficult for language teams to translate them.\nFor example, translation teams working with languages with gender marks may find it challenging to translate particular contents in a inclusive manner.\nThere can also be references to very specific contexts in some countries, or certain “internal jokes” that get (literally) lost in translation.\nYou can help make the handbook more localisable by submitting an Issue that describes the problem, or even better, a Pull Request that modifies the original text to make it more translatable.\n\nCrowdsourcing has played a pivotal role in this translation endeavor, harnessing the collective intelligence and linguistic skills of individuals passionate about open science and reproducible research.\nBy tapping into the wisdom of the crowd, The Turing Way has been able to leverage the knowledge and expertise of a global network, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant translations.\n\nThe benefits of localising and translating The Turing Way are far-reaching.\nIt not only makes this invaluable resource more accessible to non-English-speaking communities but also fosters a sense of inclusivity, enabling researchers from various cultural backgrounds to engage with best practices and principles in research reproducibility.\n\nThe translation of The Turing Way into different languages through crowdsourcing is a testament to the power of collective action and the commitment to open science principles.\nThrough the dedication and collaboration of individuals around the world, The Turing Way continues to evolve and thrive as a comprehensive and inclusive resource for the research community, transcending language barriers and fostering a culture of reproducibility on a global scale.","type":"content","url":"/community-handbook/translation/translation-hello-crowdin#embracing-global-accessibility-through-localisation-and-crowdsourcing","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Translation

and cultural context of a specific target locale.\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (\n\nW3C) defines internationalisation (i18n) as:\n\n“The design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localisation for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language”\n\nLocalisation involves more than just translation, which only transforms text.\nLocalisation addresses other factors such as text length and cultural references.\nA Translation Management System (TMS) manages the localisation process from the beginning of a translation process until the

Several Nobel Prize winners were members.\nThe union organised scientists and technicians in government and private sector research, and became a prominent propagandist for the expansion of publicly funded R&D as well as taking political positions regarding the ethical use of science, against the global threat of fascism, and of guiding scientific research towards peaceful ends.\nThe AScW went on to found the World Federation of Scientific Workers in 1946, an organisation which during the Cold War was accused of toeing the Soviet line, and being a communist front.\n\nThe AScW communicated with

direction for change and motivates people to take coordinated action.\nA vision will acknowledge that sacrifices will be needed to achieve benefits that would not be achievable without change.\nAn effective vision is imaginable (it conveys a picture of the future), desirable (appealing to anyone involved in the change), feasible (has attainable goals), focused (for clear decision-making), and flexible (to allow for alternative responses in light of changing conditions).\n\nThis vision should be easy to communicate in under five minutes.\nThe effective communication of the vision depends on the simplicity of the message, whether appropriate metaphors or pictures are used, the communication channels used, how often the message is repeated and how the behaviour is modelled by important

substantial interventions in research culture to move practices towards more open, reproducible and collaborative work.\nThese interventions have mostly been focused on either a) technological solutions seeking to address perceived failings and restrictions in the current academic publishing system or b) top-down policy requirements mandating openness (for example \n\nPlan S, \n\nUKRI open research stance).\n\nHowever, our discussion began with many participants flagging that culture is part of an overarching series of systems within society, that are all interconnected and influence each other.\nCultural change in academia, like that sought by open research advocates, therefore needs to be understood through the lens of system change.\nFor example, many advocates want the academic credit and recognition system to move away from number of papers published as a metric for success.\nThis would mean changing the way that promotions are awarded, research institutions evaluated, and academic knowledge shared.\nPublishing companies, who make large profits from publishing academic research, are likely to fight against the change if they think it will harm their profits.\nIt is always possible to change cultures, big and small, but it will be easier when we take into account the wider factors also in play.\nWhen we seek to change the was research is produced we need to identify and consider previously unconsidered barriers and pitfalls.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/cultural-change/alt-models-discussion#er-cc-am-discussion-vacuum","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Alternative Models of Culture Change in Open

infrastructure at the bottom has drawn criticisms.\nCertainly participants in the culture change discussion expressed confusion, disconnect, and disappointment at the apparent disempowerment of communities inferred from their position in the diagram, and the exclusion of key factors in driving change, such as consultation with communities, feedback loops, and the impact this approach might have on researchers.\nThe explicit hierarchy can also be interpreted as assigning relative importance to each of the stages, when often their relative importance fluctuates depending on the norms, practices, existing infrastructure, and the influence that each of these factors exerts on the other.\nAlthough the blog post in which the model is introduced offers more context about why specifically, we now frequently see the diagram taken out of context and used to justify techno-solutionism.\nAdvocates for change therefore need to think critically about designing visual representations and how they may be misinterpreted or used out of context.\nThere is a balance between using simple structures and clear diagrams, and communicating complex concepts effectively.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/cultural-change/alt-models-discussion#er-cc-am-discussion-modelsmatter","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Alternative Models of Culture Change

William and Susan Bridges"},"content":"Managing Transitions by William and Susan Bridges (\n\nBridges & Bridges, 2017) teaches us that a change will always be accompanied by a transition.\nA transition begins when something needs to be let go, and sits in between the old and the new situation.\nThis transition phase can be insecure for people who will have to adjust to a new situation, but also an opportunity for innovation to happen if people are adequately resourced and supported (by policies, groupings, procedures).\n\nThere are four P’s in transitions (\n\nBridges & Bridges, 2017):\n\nPurpose: people have to understand the logic behind the outcome and feel that the change is necessary.\n\nPicture: people need to experience how the outcome will look and feel.\n\nPlan: people need a step-by-step plan to know what they have to do.\n\nPart to play: especially if people have something to loose, they need to be able to play a part in the transition phase and eventual outcome.\n\nTo manage transitions it needs to be clear what the problem (reason for change) is.\nPeople will not change if they are not experiencing the problem and are convinced something needs to be adjusted.\nThose experiencing the problem will also have expertise and knowledge to come up with an effective solution.\nIndividuals will stand to lose something when change is happening - a sense of control over this transition helps to make the transition more comfortable.\nIt is important to learn what problems people are facing in a transition phase, and recognise individuals that do contribute to the change.\nPeople will need to feel safe to experiment and take risks, and not be punished when these experiments fail.\n\nIt is important that changes are meaningfully clustered, or held off until they can be, to avoid a messy change pile:\n\nIf changes are meaningfully clustered the changes are incorporated in the bigger change picture, and it makes sense to act on these further changes right now.\n\nIn a messy change pile, the changes are not neatly connected to the change that is already happening.\nThis can feel overwhelming as too many different changes are happening at the same time, which may pull people in different directions.\n\nTo ensure that people will change their behaviour, they will need to learn how to adapt to new behaviours through training.\nPeople will not be able to invest in this, if the new behaviours are not adequately rewarded (for example, focused placed on publications written instead of open data/software).\nShort term goals can give people a sense of achievement and encourage them to move forward.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/cultural-change/cc-examples#er-activism-cultural-change-transitions","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Culture Change Models & Examples","lvl2":"Leading Change -

Klein.\n\nData feminism is an approach to understanding and practising data science that’s informed by the principles of feminist theory. It critiques traditional data practices that often overlook gender biases and other forms of inequality and advocates for a more inclusive, equitable, and reflective practice in data science\n\nHere are some key aspects discussed within the chapter:\n\nExamine Power Structures: Data Feminism urges a critical examination of power dynamics in data practices. It questions who is represented in data, who benefits from data practices and whose interests are served.\n\nChallenge the Status Quo: This challenges existing norms in data science, such as the male/female binary and questions other hierarchical classification systems. Thus dismantling stereotypes to promote a more inclusive approach to data.\n\nInclusivity and Representation: Data Feminism emphasises the need for diverse representation in data and in data teams. When data science is dominated by a homogeneous group, especially those from privileged backgrounds, it risks perpetuating biases and inequalities.\n\nEthical Considerations and Consent: Ethical concerns such as consent and privacy are at the core of data feminism. This includes concerns about how data is collected and used and the potential for harm especially to marginalized communities.\n\nVisibility of Labour: This seeks to recognize and make the often unseen labour in data science visible; especially the contributions of women and people from marginalized groups.\n\nInterdisciplinary Approaches: Data feminism advocated for interdisciplinary work, drawing insights and methods from various fields outside of traditional data science to enrich understanding and foster more impactful outcomes.\n\nAction and Advocacy: Beyond analysis, data feminism promotes the need to advocate for change, challenge oppressive structures and promote social justice.\n\nContinual Learning and Adaptation: Data feminism acknowledges that anti-oppression work is never finished. Continuous learning is essential, and we must recognise society and technology’s dynamic nature.\n\nIn summary, data feminism is not just a theoretical framework but a practice that seeks to reshape how data is collected, analysed and used, focusing on equity, justice and dismantling traditional power structures.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/data-feminism#er-data-feminism-summary","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Feminism","lvl2":"Motivation and Background"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ethical-research/data-feminism#er-data-feminism-motivation","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Feminism","lvl2":"Motivation and Background"},"content":"Data feminism is rooted in the rich history of \n\nfeminist activism and critical theory; it challenges the status quo in data practices by advocating for inclusivity and intersectionality.\n\nDespite advancements, data science still reflects societal biases due to limited data collection and analysis perspectives.\n\nThe ethics of data collection, use and interpretation are increasingly under scrutiny. Issues around consent, privacy and the potential harm of data misuse are central to the data feminism discussion.\n\nThe impact of biased data practices is global, affecting policies, technology development and social attitudes. These global challenges must be addressed, and data feminism seeks to advocate more inclusive and representative data practices.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/data-feminism#er-data-feminism-motivation","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 1: Examining

which seeks -- amongst other things -- to distinguish right from wrong.\nNowadays, philosophers speak of three levels of discussion in ethics \n\nDittmer, 2022: metaethics, normative ethics and applied ethics.\nRoughly, metaethics questions the nature of good and evil, as well as the underlying assumptions held by different ethical frameworks.\nNormative ethics, then, provides the tools for us to create such ethical frameworks and think within them.\nApplied ethics, finally, is what is most pertinent to this guide, as we will be discussing the ins and outs of ethical and responsible research and innovation.\n\nWe begin this introductory chapter with clarifying why research ethics matters.\nThen we discuss two critical concepts relating with research ethics: responsible research and innovation and research integrity.\nWe then unpick the ethical questions different questions each concept

actions under normal circumstances.\n\nTo this effect, the importance of acting ethically within the academic sphere is heightened.\nScientists must reflect on the ethical questions their research

controversy \n\nDirectorate-General for Research and Innovation (European Commission), 2011.\nUnfortunately, this reactive nature of research ethics has led to there being many ethical codes for research, each regarding distinct fields of inquiry, designed by and for different institutions, and sometimes affecting scientific work conducted within specific regions.\nTherefore, researchers are right to feel overwhelmed by the diversity of rules and guidelines they face throughout their careers.\n\nOne source of diversity of ethical frameworks relates with how research institutions generally have “Ethics Committees” that appraise the ethics of research conducted within their institutions.\nThis is traditionally done for institutions to protect themselves from legal liabilities.\nHowever, further reflection -- beyond questions of data protection -- can be required by these processes.\nThe point is that one university’s process for ethical appraisal will, more often than not, differ from another’s.\n\nThe below section simply outlines two critical concepts in the realm of research ethics: responsible research and innovation (RRI) and research integrity.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-intro#defining-research-ethics","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Research Ethics","lvl3":"Responsible Research and

becoming an important term in the context of European policy \n\nOwen et al., 2012.\nTurning to the European Union’s “Horizon 2020” research programme, we can find one definition of RRI:\n\n“[RRI is] an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation” (European Commission, n.d.).\n\nThere are two aspects of this definition worth focusing on for the purpose of this introductory section.\nFirstly, RRI refers to “potential implications and societal expectations.”\nSecondly, it is about “the design of inclusive and sustainable research”.\nThese are two traditionally important aspects of the ethics of science: how research is set up or designed, and what societal consequences this setup has.\nWhat is important here is that we consider these aspects of research when speaking of making it ethical.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-intro#responsible-research-and-innovation","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Research Ethics","lvl3":"Research

principles and professional standards essential for the responsible practice of research” - Korenman, 2006 \n\nKorenman, 2006.\n\nWhat this term brings into the discussion about research ethics are “professional standards” and “responsible practice”.\nUnlike in RRI, the question is no longer on the ethics of scientific output and its consequences, but on the ethics of how scientists conduct themselves in practice.\nResearch integrity, in a sense, captures the ethics of the work done “behind the scenes”, outside the view of the general public.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-intro#research-integrity","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction to Research Ethics","lvl4":"Comparing RRI to Research

Research Integrity","lvl3":"Research Integrity","lvl2":"Defining Research Ethics"},"content":"The two concepts of RRI and research integrity are by no means entirely distinct, as they can overlap in important ways.\nHowever, three differences between both concepts are outlined below for the purpose of drawing out more diverse questions pertaining to research ethics at large.\nA table with the list of concept specific questions is shared at the end of this subsection.\n\nFirstly, we can see that who perceives the ethical questions differs in either case.\nTo start with, RRI can be understood as outward-looking, or visible to the public.\nFor example, people might ask for what it means when scientists keep animals’ brains alive hours after their decapitation \n\nReardon, 2019.\nIn the meantime, research integrity refers to how research findings are produced — it is inward-looking.\nA common term to describe a lack of research integrity is “research misconduct”, for which there are many examples.\nOne such example is that of Brian Wansink’s work in food science, who endorsed p-hacking and has had a number of papers retracted (see \n\nMarcus & Oransky, 2018).\n\nSecondly, each term refers to different people scientists interact with during research.\nOn the one hand, RRI questions how scientists engage with research subjects.\nConsider, for example, how volunteers are treated during clinical trials.\nThe point here is to work with data subjects in a respectful and inclusive way.\nOne (in)famous case in which there was no respect for data subjects was the Tuskagee experiments, wherein African-American men were recruited to study the development of untreated syphilis, but the volunteers were falsely told they were receiving free treatment — the monitoring and lies persisted for forty years \n\nDisease Control & Prevention, 2021.\nOn the other hand, we can question how scientists engage with fellow researchers.\nWe can here discuss the importance of codes of conduct in open source collaborations, for example, \n\nThe Turing Way’s; or — returning to “research misconduct” — how one might engage in authorship fraud.\nOnce again, there are many examples of this sort of practice.\nFrom being insincere about who contributed to a paper because the academic incentives system almost encourages this \n\nHarvey, 2018 to inventing entirely fictional authors \n\nLowe, 2016\n\nMarcus & Oransky, 2016, these are questions that are not commonly within the public’s purview.\n\nThirdly, RRI and research integrity question the ethics of how scientific solutions are framed and shaped either by society at large (RRI) or by institutional practices in particular (research integrity).\nWith our RRI hat on, we can ask how we communicate the validity of scientific outputs.\nWhilst how scientific findings are communicated is not a new question, it is worth highlighting that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning might be framed as delivering much more for research and innovation than what they actually can.\nAlong these lines, we can ask about the role of “AI” as a marketing tool, as a way to grant research findings undeserved credibility \n\nLanier & Weyl, 2020.\nA more specific example is available in Nagendran et al.'s concerns over exaggerated claims of AI outperforming doctors \n\nNagendran et al., 2020.\nSwitching to our research integrity goggles, we can question how academic infrastructures shape scientific work.\n\nConsider, for example, how researchers must weigh the noble pursuit of truth, with the need to earn credit (on this weighing of options, see, for example, \n\nZollman, 2018).\nWe can also reflect on the impact of funding on scientific endeavours.\nQuestions can be raised regarding the size of research grants \n\nBloch & Sørensen, 2015 and even the values that motivate the funding of some research projects and not others.\nInstitutional norms might even encourage a “publication bias” whereby positively framed findings will be easier to get published (see \n\nKaiser et al., 2009 finding that studies showing differences in sex/gender are easier to publish than studies not supporting such differences).\n\nBelow is a table illustrating the three differences outlined above.\nThe point here is not to argue for this conceptual distinction but to introduce two important concepts in research ethics and, in doing so, present different questions we must be ready to reflect on when thinking about ethical research.\n\nFactor\n\nRRI\n\nResearch

Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation), which a governance model might also need to take into account, for example, how is delegated power dealt with by the project?\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation, illustration credit -

perhaps even successfully - that the governance system has all the ethical solutions worked out, or even all the practical challenges have been considered.\nFor instance, the “benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) open source governance model has practical as well as ethical issues: what if that BDFL has an unexpected health crisis and disappears?\nWhat if the benevolent dictator begins displaying values that are at odds with those of the wider community?\nWhat if they’re missing viewpoints that were obvious if only the governance committee was more than one person?\nTake python as an example.\nOriginally set up as a “benevolent dictatorship for life”, the BDFL, Guide Van Rossum, \n\neventually abdicated and transferred power to the community in 2018, citing burnout as the main reason.\nBenevolent dictatorships for life limit the sustainability of open source projects by tying them too closely to one person, and remove formal paths for intervention when something goes wrong.\n\nRelying on technology to be your governance is equally risky.\nTechnology can be an incredible tool, but so long as it’s the only tool you have put in place for making governance decisions, it’s likely to be a potential problem.\nThis is why it is important to start the process of governance selections with self-reflection, so that you are aware of all the requirements in the projects and prepared to implement ethical measures for them.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-open-source-governance#er-ethics-open-source-governance-technology","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Ethical Considerations when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model","lvl2":"Conclusion"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-open-source-governance#er-ethics-open-source-governance-conclusion","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Ethical Considerations when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model","lvl2":"Conclusion"},"content":"By its nature, open source technology can deliver benefits to all societies.\nHowever, projects started with all the best of intentions can still evolve into something malicious through poor guidance and oversight.\nSuch considerations should therefore be noted and addressed through the application of a formal governing structure throughout any such projects, especially in sensitive areas where conflicts are likely to arise.\nWhile the use of a governance structure doesn’t negate the possibility of bad things from happening, it does however provide a framework which allows us to put such actions into context.\nIn this chapter, we have provided some ethical pointers for open source project communities to consider when constructing their governance models, to support the continual evolution of open source towards a more just and equitable ecosystem for all contributors and users.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-open-source-governance#er-ethics-open-source-governance-conclusion","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Ethical Considerations when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model","lvl2":"Additional Resources"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ethical-research/ethics-open-source-governance#er-ethics-open-source-governance-resources","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Ethical Considerations when Choosing an Open Source Governance Model","lvl2":"Additional Resources"},"content":"Invest in Open Infrastructure -

forms of technology to collect and use data in new ways.\nBecause data protection laws sit at the limits of what companies - especially big tech giants - are able to do, the process of making, updating and enforcing data protection laws has become increasingly newsworthy.\nFor example, new pieces of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\n\nGDPR) in the EU have

include, for example, medical or financial information about a person.\n\nPrivacy laws have periodically been updated to take into account new technologies, which have offered new ways for privacy to be invaded and for information about people to be shared.\nThis started in the 19th century when newspapers became widespread, and is still happening as legislators try to keep up with developments in the internet and in data collection.\n\nPrivacy is sometimes confused with data protection, but it is much broader.\nFor example, the right to privacy protects individuals from having blood samples taken without their permission.\nIt means that body searches must be done in a way that preserves the dignity of the person being searched, and that home searches must only be done to search for evidence, not for harassment.\nIt also makes laws that criminalise private, consensual sex between adults of the same sex unlawful (nonetheless, these laws have not yet been repealed

covers creative works, and gives the owner the right to make copies.\n\ntrademark: covers goods or services, and identifies them as coming from a particular provider.\n\npatent: covers inventions, and gives the owner the right to stop other actors from making or selling that invention.\n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organisation (the UN agency which oversees intellectual property issues) has

intellectual property law also varies by jurisdiction.\nIn general, it is the owner of the intellectual property who is responsible for enforcing their rights, for example by suing another person in court.\n\nYou should know who owns the intellectual property you create.\nIn some situations, it will be you personally.\nIf you are employed, depending on the terms of your employment, your employer may own the intellectual property you create while you work for them.\nThis may impact what you are able to do with the intellectual property you create, including the terms under which you can

intra-organisational, or governmental level.\nIt is useful to be aware, for example, of policies on ethical research and innovation that are set by your government, or your funding organisation.\nFor example, the American Statistical Association has created \n\nethical guidelines for statistical practice.\nPolicies can also be set by national or international organisations.\nIf you are a member of a professional or academic organisation, you should be aware of the policies that cover ethical research for your profession.\n\nMany ethical guidelines that have been produced are in the form of policy.\nThese can provide useful guidance.\n\nBecause policies are the result of negotiation and agreement, they can be influenced.\nIf you don’t think your professional organisation’s policies are strong or effective enough, you can lobby for changes as a member of that organisation.\nThe process for doing this will depend on the organisation.\nMany companies and organisations have advocacy and

not have their human rights abused or violated;\n\nfulfil: to take action to make sure that individuals and groups are able to enjoy their human rights.- add Scriberia human rights illustration here \n\nSome human rights law is made at global level, by the United Nations.\nThere are nine \n\ncore human rights instruments.\nThey include general instruments on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, as well as instruments that cover specific people, such as children or people with disabilities, or specific topics, such as torture or racial discrimination.\nEach of these instruments is overseen by a committee of experts: a ‘treaty body.’\nEvery few years, each country who has signed a human rights instrument has to report to the treaty body on how well they are implementing the treaty.\nThe treaty body makes recommendations on how the country can continue to improve its implementation.\nThe treaty bodies also periodically issue more detailed guidance on how to interpret different articles of their treaty, to help countries understand better what their obligations are.\n\nThere are also regional human rights instruments:\n\nAfrican Charter on Human and People’s Rights, which covers 54 of the 55 members of the \n\nAfrican Union.\n\nAmerican Convention on Human Rights, which covers 23 of the 35 members of the \n\nOrganization of American States.\n\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, which covers the 47 members of the \n\nCouncil of Europe.\n\nCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which covers the 27 members of the \n\nEuropean Union\n\nSome countries have ratified some of the treaties that apply to them: this means that they have incorporated the content of the treaties into their national law.\nMany countries also have a national human rights institution, which independently monitors and investigates human rights violations in that country, and advises the government on implementing their obligations.\n\nCountries that have signed treaties have committed to implementing them.\nHowever, the process of implementing treaties in full, so that every person in a country can enjoy all the rights in a treaty, is very long and requires lots of actions from states.\nCampaigning groups, including non-governmental organisations, work to narrow the gap between what countries have promised to do, and what they have actually done so far.\nSome campaigning groups are international and work on lots of different human rights issues.\nSome work only on a small number of issues, or in a small area of the world.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/law-policy/law-policy-rights#what-is-human-rights-law","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Human

of human rights, and the ways that they are implemented, are agreed internationally,\nA violation of human rights is a violation wherever it happens.\nThis is not necessarily true of codes of ethics.\nAn action that one group of people sees as ethical, may be seen as unethical by others.\nThere is a wider shared understanding of what human rights means across different countries, cultures and groups of people.\nThere are accountability and enforcement mechanisms.\nBut because they are a legal framework, they are not as easily accessible, and hard to apply to the daily work of data science and research.\n\nHuman rights treaties are signed by countries: that means that ultimately, it is countries that are held responsible for violations of human rights.\nHowever, that does not mean that researchers and data scientists are exempt from thinking about the human rights impact of their work!\n\nThe UN has produced specific guidance for companies on how to ensure that they respect human rights: the \n\nUN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\nCompanies should comply with these Guiding Principles.\n\nNGOs and other campaigning organisations also produce guidance on specific areas:\n\nThe Toronto Declaration: Protecting the rights to equality and non-discrimination in machine learning systems(prepared by Amnesty International and Access Now and it has been endorsed by Human Rights Watch and Wikimedia Foundation)\n\nMaking sure that research complies with human rights is not just about ensuring that it doesn’t harm.\nIt can also be about doing work that is actively pro-rights.\n\nResearchers and data scientists should, in general ensure that they:\n\nrespect human rights: this means not doing work that itself abuses human rights\n\nprotect human

This provides the lenses through which we see the world and influences the way we behave, including how we do research.\nThese could be ‘macro’ influences like our motivations to address a particular problem, or ‘micro’ like the way we numerically represent a social concept.While there are lots of benefits to the individual ways we all experience the world, the single view each person takes can also embed unseen biases into how we think and work.\n\nBy better understanding ourselves, we can be more proactive about spotting where we might hold biases or gaps in our knowledge.\nThis means we can be transparent about how our unique view has influenced the way we work, which is beneficial to scientific integrity and reproducibility.\nIt can also help us to identify and work against systemic and structural barriers that might otherwise go unchallenged, in order to make our research environments more inclusive (see \n\nActivism).\n\nThe placement of our identities, socio-cultural position and epistemological approach [\n\ndef] to knowledge in the context of our research is called our positionality.\nWe can understand our positionality through the practice of reflexivity, which is the process of using self-reflection [\n\ndef] to better understand how our identities and experiences influence the way we behave in our work.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-positionality","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Identity and positionality","lvl2":"Understanding ourselves"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-positionality#er-self-reflection-social-graces","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Identity and positionality","lvl2":"Understanding ourselves"},"content":"Self-reflection and reflexivity can be challenging, and takes time and practice to feel natural.\nTo be most effective, they should be employed throughout our work and will never be ‘finished’ as we constantly change and so does the world around us.\n\nIn order to help get started, there are lots of frameworks that can be used as a guide.\nOne of these is called the ‘Social Graces’, which was developed by psychotherapists John Burnham, Alison Roper-Hall and colleagues in the 1990s \n\nBurnham, 2012.\n\nThe Social Graces are a mnemonic to help cover aspects of identity that affect our power and privilege.\nThey are not fixed and you can choose the most relevant ones, or add more.\nThe idea of the Social Graces was to explicitly name power differentials, which might be visible or invisible in our interactions.\n\nG = Gender, Geography\n\nR = Race, Religion\n\nA = Age, Ability, Appearance\n\nC = Class, Culture\n\nE = Ethnicity, Education, Employment\n\nS = Sexuality, Sexual Orientation, Spirituality\n\nThe Graces are a helpful place to start thinking about your intersecting identities.\n\nIt can also be helpful to ask:\n\nWhich of the Social Graces do I particularly identify with?

This means that there has not been a diverse group of people to direct the aims of data science work, and so many groups are likely to be overlooked when considering the negative impacts and potential benefits of data science.\n\nThe English language is the default in many programming languages and academic settings, which creates barriers to knowledge sharing and inclusion. Rather than English speakers learning other languages, it is generally expected that non-English speakers learn English in order to participate and collaborate, which frames English as the default.\n\nData science work can require huge amounts of energy and computational power, which disproportionality affects the lives of people living in the places most affected by climate change. These countries tend to already be economically disadvantaged relative to others, and have less access to the resources needed to manage the impacts of climate change.\n\nBroader structural aspects of power and privilege can seem too big to counter on our own, but they also play out in individual interactions where we have much more control.\nBy understanding systems and structures of power and oppression, and where we sit within them, we can better identify where change needs to happen, and what we can do to contribute to that change.","type":"content","url":"/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-power","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Power and privilege","lvl2":"Intersectionality"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ethical-research/self-reflection/sr-power#intersectionality","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Power and privilege","lvl2":"Intersectionality"},"content":"Intersectionality [\n\ndef] is an important concept to know and understand when thinking about power, privilege and identity.\n\nThe term intersectionality refers to how multiple identities can intersect, and so people can be oppressed on the basis of combinations of their identities instead of, or as well as, their separate identities.\nThe term was coined by Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989 \n\nCrenshaw, 1989 to describe the way that laws that protected Black people and women separately.\nHowever, Black women were not by default protected against discrimination that exclusively affected Black women.\nNow, the term ‘intersectionality’ has become more widely used and broadly refers to how people are often disadvantaged by multiple sources of oppression.\n\nIntersectionality has sometimes incorrectly been assumed to be a way of making a ‘hierarchy of oppression’, which is not its purpose.

Sharing these research outputs means understanding and applying a range of practices, including open science, data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques — skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.\nFurthermore, technical skill alone is not sufficient for making research reproducible and open for all.\n\nThe Turing Way provides resources to build an understanding of good practices and improve research habits through modular chapters in a self-contained handbook.\nRather than reinventing the wheel by rewriting or redefining data science best practices, we encourage you to introduce known methods, tools and approaches in accessible language in The Turing Way chapters.\nIn these chapters, you can highlight existing resources, curated materials and external links, setting readers up for diving deeper into topics of their choice.\n\nThe book started in January 2019 as a guide for reproducibility, covering \n\nVersion Control, \n\nCode Testing, and \n\nContinuous integration.\nHowever, technical skills are just one aspect of making data science research “open for all”.\nHence, in February 2020, The Turing Way expanded into a series of guides: \n\nGuide for Reproducible Research, \n\nGuide for Project Design, \n\nGuide for Communication, \n\nGuide for Collaboration, and \n\nGuide for Ethical Research.\nThrough community contributions, the project has grown into multiple guides, a global community and numerous resources built and shared by the members of our community.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

Find it.\n\nNever a failure, always a lesson\n\nTrust the People (If you trust the people, they become trustworthy)\n\nMove at the speed of trust\n\nFocus on critical connections more than critical mass—build the resilience by building the relationships\n\nLess prep, more presence\n\nWhat you pay attention to grows\n\nThis \n\nblog post by Forte Labs gives a great overview of the principles.\nThey aren’t really separable and are lenses on the whole philosophy that Brown espouses.","type":"content","url":"/foreword/emergent-strategy","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Emergence as The Turing Way’s Strategy","lvl2":"1.

Sometimes it can be tempting to lie down on the floor and give up when you realise just how stacked against those collaborative practices our current incentive structures can be.\n\nWhat I love about this first principle of emergent strategy is that it gives us a pathway to making that change.\n\nWant to see a kinder world? Be kind to the next person you interact with.\n\nWant to see a more reproducible publishing ecosystem?\nHelp the next person you collaborate with to re-run their analyses to confirm the same answer.\n\nWant data scientists to be more representative of our global community in terms of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability and so many more dimensions and their intersections?\nEncourage the next person you mentor to share their perspective. Especially if that person is yourself.\n\nThe Turing Way is a space where I hope you can start taking steps towards that change.","type":"content","url":"/foreword/emergent-strategy#fw-emergent-strategy-1","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Emergence as The Turing Way’s Strategy","lvl2":"2.

project have been led and executed by different groups of people.\nFor example, since 2020, localisation and translation work has been carried out by a group of international community members, who although initially worked in an ad-hoc manner, later were named and recognised as the ‘Translation and Localisation Team’.\nSimilarly, in 2021, after moving Book Dash as an online event, a ‘Book Dash Planning Committee’ was convened yearly joined by a few previous attendees of Book Dashes who supported the planning and delivery of the event.\nNonetheless, the formation of WGs had largely remained informal: after existing streams of work had been identified, community members engaged with the work were formally recognised and encouraged to develop ways of working that aligned with their needs.\n\nHowever, as the community has grown, WGs have been more formally established and explicit pathways are being created to formalise WGs.\n\nGuidelines and resources for  WGs are shared in the Community Handbook. <-- At the time of writing, this chapter is under review (\n\nsee

extracted a list of repositories from \n\nGHArchive and subsequently cloned all of them using a large CPU cluster.\nThey also used the data from GHArchive to extract the Github issues.\nThe git commits were gathered from a public BigQuery service.\nAdditionally, they collected a dataset of annotations of several kinds of private information on a subset of The Stack to support our privacy risk mitigation efforts.\n\nThe legal basis for data collection under fair use and with regards to GDPR and the corresponding case law are still evolving.\nIn this context, the data collection and data management plans were carefully crafted with support from leading experts in the open source and legal tech community that participated in the BigCode Legal, Ethics, Governance Working Group in a best-effort approach to reflect current understandings of legal requirements for data collection and management.\n\nThe following sections will dive into the details of how the team approached key

Collection","lvl2":"Data Collection and Management Plan"},"content":"The StarCoder model was trained on The Stack v1.2, which exclusively contains 6.4TB of permissively licensed data from GitHub repositories, processed from an original source dataset of 102TB.\nSelecting repositories based on licenses is only the first step, however, so this approach is complemented by also giving repository owners the ability to opt out of having their repositories included in The Stack, described further in the Data Management & Opt-out section.\n\nData selection: One of the goals of BigCode is to give developers agency over their source code and let them decide whether or not it can be used to develop and evaluate LLMs.\nSoftware developers typically rely on licenses to express how they want their work to be re-used.\nIn particular, developers who choose Open Source licenses often do so because they want their code to be broadly re-used.\nThis motivated us to start by selecting data from repositories that met the following criteria:\n\nThe repository has an open source license attached - open source, while chosen for very different reasons by different people, typically indicates a willingness to have one’s work reused or adapted\n\nThe license does not have an attribution clause - attribution is a difficult technical problem for code LLMs.\nSince they cannot guarantee that the model will be used in a way that attributes its generations to specific training data in a way that satisfies the intent of the licensor, they chose to only keep licenses without an attribution clause\n\nData updates: For as long as the BigCode team is maintaining The Stack dataset, they will provide regular updates to the dataset to remove data that has been flagged since the last version.\nThis includes data that has been opted out, and data that was flagged as containing PII, malicious code or using a non-permissive license since the previous release.\nThe current plan is to update the dataset every 3 months, although the schedule may change based on the volume of requests received.\nIf the team is no longer in a position to continue maintaining the dataset, they plan to stop distributing it in its current format and update its terms of use to limit its range of applications further.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/data-security/data-governance/bigcode-casestudy#data-collection","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"BigCode Data Governance Case Study","lvl3":"Data

and finding that most would not provide sufficient transparency and guarantees about worker compensation.\nWe selected pay and eligible countries of crowd-workers to ensure that:\n\nAbsolute hourly wage was always higher than the US federal minimum wage ($7.30)\n\nHourly wage was equivalent to the highest state minimum wage in the US in terms of purchasing power parity ($16.50 at the time of writing)\n\nTraining a PII detection model: We engaged 1,399 crowd-workers across 35 countries in annotating a diverse dataset for PII in source code.\nOur PII detection model, trained on 22,950 secrets, achieves 90% F1 score surpassing regex-based tools, especially for secret keys.\nThe PII annotations are available to approved individuals, and researchers and developers that are granted access are expected to uphold ethical standards and data protection measures.\nBy making it accessible, our aim is to encourage further research and development of PII redaction technology.\n\nLearn more about the PII redaction process through this \n\nblog post from Toloka.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/data-security/data-governance/bigcode-casestudy#data-processing","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"BigCode Data Governance Case Study","lvl2":"Acknowledgments"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/project-design/data-security/data-governance/bigcode-casestudy#acknowledgments","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"BigCode Data Governance Case Study","lvl2":"Acknowledgments"},"content":"This case study is based on the BigCode Governance card, thanks to the efforts of the \n\nhundreds of BigCode participants, a living document that will evolve over time with the BigCode project.\nPlease leave any comments in the \n\nHuggingFace Community space to ask a question or start a conversation about BigCode project governance.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/data-security/data-governance/bigcode-casestudy#acknowledgments","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Governance for the Machine Learning Pipeline"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/data-security/data-governance/data-gov-ml","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Governance for the Machine Learning Pipeline"},"content":"A Machine Learning (ML) pipeline consists of a series of activities including the collection of data, training of an ML model, and the deployment of the model into use.\nData is integral throughout the ML process and the methods for which data is collected, annotated, processed, and shared will impact individuals and communities who may be represented in or the creators of the data, as well as data users who would like access to the data.\n\nIn addition to the technical decisions and team members involved in data governance, it is also important to think about the wider community involved in an ML project, including the data contributors, data subjects, data stewards, data annotators, and communities impacted by the model outputs.\nWhen possible, a ML team should consider how this wider community can be involved in data, model, and project governance.\nThis can empower more people involved in and impacted by the machine learning pipeline and ensure more effective, sustainable, and equitable practices.\nThe following framework can support the understanding of different community governance opportunities in the ML pipeline.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Governance Opportunities in the Machine Learning Pipeline.

available for download (sometimes with restrictions on its usage, such as only being available for use in academic settings).\nThe deep learning (DL) family of models, in particular, relies on massive corpuses of data such as text, code, images, sound, and other media.\nThe process of data collection depends on the type and volume of data required and sources for acquisition.\nFor example, a project that uses patient health record data versus a project that uses a dataset of millions of social media posts will require different processes for gaining access to data as well as actually collecting and storing the data.\nMany DL models rely on data scraped from the internet due to the sheer volume of digital content that is available on the web.\nFor example, \n\nImageNet datasets are sourced from web images from image hosting websites like Flickr, and \n\nLAION datasets come from web crawling sources like Common Crawl.\nThese methods of data collection through web scraping have raised issues regarding data quality and bias due to the nature of using uncurated Internet data, as well as issues of data rights as web scraped data sets often include copyrighted data or data obtained without consent that may be in violation of the data license and terms of use.\nTo address issues related to respecting data licenses, ML teams should be mindful of using data only when compatible with the license, including open source or permissively licensed data.\nThis can be challenging to accomplish with data that does not have explicit licenses, or for data scraped from the web which may not have the license included in the metadata.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/data-security/data-governance/data-gov-ml#pd-dg-ml-dc","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data

could include details like sensitive personal data, salary information, bank details, research data with significant commercial value or obligations.\nIf this kind of data is compromised or destroyed in an unauthorized way, it could greatly impact the organizations/individuals involved and they could face repercussions.\nUnauthorized disclosure may result in fines, legal action, reputational damage, economic losses, and other consequences.\n\nMedium sensitivity / restricted data - could include details like personal data that is not classified as ‘sensitive’, student/alumni contact details, staff contact details.\nThis kind of data is usually for internal usages only, and if compromised or destroyed in an unauthorized way, would not be as impactful as high sensitivity data on the organizations/individuals involved.\n\nLow sensitivity / internal data - could include details like non-confidential internal correspondence, working group minutes, internal policies and procedures.\nThis kind of data could also comprise of data intended for public use, like public website contents or press releases.\n\nAccording to the information guidelines provided by \n\nImperva, data could be classified based on content, context or user-based.\n\nContent-based classification -  involves inspecting and interpreting files and documents looking for sensitive information while reviewing them, and classifying based on that.\n\nContext-based classification -  involves looking into the metadata to classify, such as the application which created the file, person/people involved in its creation, or the location of its authorization.\nSome questions one can ask while looking for this classification are:\n\nHow is the data being used?\n\nWho has the access to it?\n\nWhen are they accessing it?\n\nUser-based classification -  involves the expertise of judgement made by one or more knowledgeable users in classifying the file or document.\nHence, they would be advising on specifying how sensitive the data is and make necessary changes or edits before they release it.\n\nIn terms of research the most common reasons data falls under the high sensitivity data are:\n\nResearch data containing personal identifying information, ‘personal data’ and special categories data as defined in UK and European data protection legislation.\nSuch as involvement of human participants, particularly where the research involves sensitive personal data such as health records\n\nInvolvement of commercial collaborators, particularly where the data could be construed as competitive intelligence\n\nData relating to species of plants or animals where the release of data may adversely affect rare or endangered species\n\nData likely to harm an individual or community or have a significant negative public impact if released\n\nWorking under the terms of a non-disclosure agreement\n\nOrganizations usually share guidances and links on storing sensitive data, controlling access to sensitive data, encrypting sensitive data, anonymising sensitive data, transferring sensitive data, and disposing of sensitive data.\nAdhering to the safety protocols are highly essential for ensuring data safety and security. You can learn more about this in the section on \n\nData Privacy Strategy.\n\nReproducible research is often thought to require open data or open workflows, but it is possible to work reproducibly within sensitive data projects to demonstrate research quality and create a transparent research record to enable reproducibility.\nThere are a number of ways to do this that still fulfill the legal and ethical requirements of working with sensitive data such as using advanced version control tools within private repositories or data safe havens throughout the project, and considering carefully how the project can be published to protect the privacy needs of the data but demonstrate research quality.\nThese are versions of inner source working in which open collaboration and open communication practices are used to form and record the research lifecycle creating a transparent record.\nTherefore each research project needs to find the best solution for their needs.\n\nThe following sub-chapters give an overview of the types of sensitive data and metadata that need to be identified in datasets and therefore handled securely in research projects.\n\nHere is a short video introducing sensitive data by ELIXIR-UK.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/data-security/sdp/types","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Managing Sensitive Data Projects"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/data-security/sdpm","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Managing Sensitive Data Projects"},"content":"\n\nFigure 1:The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

Data minimisation\n\nIf personal information isn’t needed, don’t collect it.\n\nPeriodically review whether you are retaining unnecessary identifying information.\n\nWhen identifying information is no longer needed, safely remove, delete or destroy it.\n\n2. Data retention limits\n\nDecide how long you will retain identifiable data before removing direct identifiers, applying more complex anonymisation techniques, or deleting the data altogether.\n\nWhen deleting sensitive data you need to be aware that standard methods for deleting files (for example moving files to the recycle bin and emptying it) are not secure.\nThese deleted files may be recovered.\nUse software like BleachBit (Linux, Windows), BC Wipe, DeleteOnClick and Eraser (Windows) or Permanent Eraser or ‘secure empty trash’ (Mac) to safely delete the data.\nAn alternative is the physical destruction of the storage media.\nDegaussing disturbs the magnetic alignment of magnetic storage media (such as hard drives and tapes) and may render those unusable.\nIf you encrypted the data (see point 4 below), you can also delete the encryption key.\n\n3. Secure data transfer\n\nBefore deciding to transfer personal data, you should consider whether the transfer of identifiable data is necessary.\nFor example, can data be de-identified or anonymised?\n\nIf data cannot be made unidentifiable then you must ensure you have authority to transfer the personal data, and that there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect the data before, during and after transit.\n\nKeeping data in one place is safer than transferring it elsewhere.\nConsider whether it is possible to provide access to the data, instead of transferring them outside of your institution.\n\nOften your university or institute will provide solutions for secure file transfer.\nContact your research data, privacy or IT support team for guidance.\n\n4. Encryption\n\nEncryption provides protection by ensuring that only someone with the relevant encryption key (or password) will be able to access the contents.\n\nProtect on disk level: Bitlocker for Windows, FileVault for MacOS\n\nProtect on “container” level (a folder containing multiple files):  Veracrypt (or Archive for MacOS)\n\nPortable storage: Bitlocker\n\nFile level / Exchange information:\n\nSimple method: use 7zip, and pack with a password\n\nMore complicated to setup: use PGP tooling (can also be used to securely send email)\n\nSee the \n\nGhent University Encryption for Researchers manual for more details and step-by-step guides\n\n5. Access permissions\n\nControl who has access to which parts of the data, and which type of permissions they have, such as “read” vs. “write” access.\n\nDeny access to sensitive data if that access is no longer needed.\n\nPassword protection.\n\n6. Anonymisation\n\nAnonymisation is a process by which identifying information in a dataset is removed.\nIt is used primarily to allow data to be shared or published without revealing the confidential information it contains.\n\nWhere possible, direct identifiers (such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and account numbers) should be removed as soon as the identifying information is no longer needed.\nYou can delete the data or replace it with pseudonyms.\nFor qualitative data you should replace or generalise identifying characteristics when transcribing interviews.\n\nDe-identified data that can be re-identified using a linkage file (for example, information linking data subjects to identifiable individuals) is known as pseudonymised data.\nNOTE: In this instance, the linkage file should be encrypted and stored securely and separately from the de-identified research data.\n\nIdentification of individuals in pseudonymised or de-identified data may still be possible using combinations of indirect identifiers (such as age, education, employment, geographic area and medical conditions).\nFurther, data and outputs containing small cell counts may be potentially disclosive, particularly where samples are drawn from small populations or include cases with extreme values or relatively rare characteristics.\n\nAs such, when intending to share potentially identifiable data or the outputs generated from the data, you may need to consider more advanced anonymisation techniques such as statistical disclosure control (SDC, see \n\nthis handbook for more information).\n\nFor more information about anonymisation\n\nWatch \n\nthis webinar by Enrico Glerean\n\nWatch a presentation on \n\nAmnesia – Data Anonymisation Made Easy or a webinar on \n\nAmnesia - a tool to make anonymisation easy\n\nOr read an \n\nexplanation by the Finnish social science data archive\n\nAnonymisation step-by-step","type":"content","url":"/project-design/data-security/sdpm/data-privacy-strategies","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Informed consent"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/data-security/sdpm/informed","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Informed consent"},"content":"Informed, voluntary and fair consent to participate in a study is very important for any research project that involves human participants.\nIt is through this consent process that research participants can understand what taking part in a specific study will mean for them, and how their data will be handled during the research project.\nEach person can then choose whether to participate using the consent form.\nSee also the \n\nGuide for Ethical Research.\n\nNote that the informed consent form is considered to be personal data and should therefore be handled with the same care as other personal data.\nDo not store the consent forms where you store the rest of the data you collect;

These methods are easy to implement and suitable when there are a small number of missing values in a large dataset.\n\nIn contrast, multiple imputation methods can generate several values for each missing value. This means that multiple imputation methods can also have an average value and variance assigned to each imputed value, thereby giving the option to test the stability of downstream analyses. One popular multiple imputation method is Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), which is explained \n\nbelow.- \nAnother method is Hot-deck, which involves using values from matching or most similar rows, to impute missing values.\n\n\nThe more complicated imputation methods, such as those under the model-based, machine learning and optimization algorithm imputation headings tend to perform better when there are many missing values and can handle many types of missing data. These are harder to implement and usually require very large sample sizes to produce consistent results.\n\nNote\n\nSome model-based methods can also be used to directly estimate model parameters for further downstream analyses (rather than directly calculating values to impute).\n\nGreat care should be taken with imputation methods, as they may introduce or further amplify existing bias.

It uses the most complete data to inform the values of increasingly less complete entries. This is done iteratively in cycles, such that at the end of each cycle there is one set of imputed values \n\nBuuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011. A slightly more detailed explanation follows below.\n\nThe first step of a cycle involves filling in the missing values of all variables, using a simple method. Then, the variable with the least number of missing values are set back to missing. The observed values of that variable are regressed on variables in the rest of the dataset. Imputed values are then estimated using this regression model, and the missing values are replaced \n\nAzur et al., 2011. A different type of regression can be used for each variable, such that each variable is handled separately and can be assigned a unique distribution. This imputation also includes some randomness to capture the uncertainty of the imputed  \n\nWulff & Jeppesen, 2017. Next, the variable with the 2nd least number of missing values are set back to missing and imputed as described previously, and so on. This is done iteratively, even after all missing values have been imputed. At the end of a set number of iterations over all variables (for example, 50 iterations), the cycle is complete and each missing value now has an unbiased estimated imputed value.\n\nOften, MICE is done repeatedly, such that an average value and variance are obtained per imputed value. Therefore, 5 cycles may be completed, so that there are 5 imputed values per missing data point. Simulations can also be used to estimate the performance of MICE in a given dataset, and determine whether values are imputed within a certain tolerance. Another method of evaluating the imputation is by comparing the distributions of the original and the imputed data. If the distributions are quite similar, then the imputed values match.\n\nExample Imputation:\nBelow we provide code implementation of imputing missing values in our example dataset (introduced in \n\nMissing Data Structures) using the R mice package \n\nBuuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011:# use mice to create 5 imputed datasets (m=5) using predictive mean matching (meth='pmm') and 50 maximum iterations\ntemporary_dataset <- mice(fictional_dataset,m=5,maxit=50,meth='pmm',seed=500)\n# impute the values using the first of the five datasets\nimputed_dataset <- complete(temporary_dataset,1)\n\nWhich has the following output:\n\nParticipant Number\n\nAge\n\nDiastolic Blood Pressure\n\nSystolic Blood Pressure\n\nBlood Test Result\n\nMotor Score\n\nCognitive Score\n\n1\n\n56\n\n82\n\n118\n\nPositive\n\n10\n\n35\n\n2\n\n78\n\n87\n\n134\n\nNegative\n\n32\n\n29\n\n3\n\n85\n\n83\n\n134\n\nNegative\n\n27\n\n22\n\n4\n\n43\n\n83\n\n121\n\nNegative\n\n15\n\n36\n\n5\n\n67\n\n86\n\n131\n\nPositive\n\n20\n\n25\n\n6\n\n82\n\n92\n\n133\n\nNegative\n\n26\n\n22\n\n7\n\n88\n\n92\n\n133\n\nPositive\n\n34\n\n25\n\n8\n\n71\n\n87\n\n133\n\nNegative\n\n33\n\n22\n\nThe average of all 5 imputed datasets is as follows:\n\nParticipant.Number\n\nAge\n\nDiastolic Blood Pressure\n\nSystolic Blood Pressure\n\nBlood Test Result\n\nMotor Score\n\nCognitive Score\n\n1\n\n56\n\n82\n\n118\n\nNegative\n\n10\n\n35\n\n2\n\n78\n\n87\n\n134\n\nNegative\n\n32\n\n29\n\n3\n\n85\n\n83\n\n131\n\nNegative\n\n27\n\n28\n\n4\n\n43\n\n83\n\n121\n\nPositive\n\n15\n\n36\n\n5\n\n67\n\n86\n\n131\n\nPositive\n\n20\n\n25\n\n6\n\n82\n\n92\n\n133\n\nPositive\n\n26\n\n28\n\n7\n\n88\n\n87\n\n127\n\nPositive\n\n34\n\n29\n\n8\n\n71\n\n86\n\n133\n\nPositive\n\n33\n\n22\n\nwhere for the blood test results, the most common value was chosen.

However, this is not the ideal dataset to be using MICE. In fact, MICE is suited best for MAR data and as we know our example dataset has all 3 types of data missingness.\n\nIn a more realistic dataset, the function parameters can be adjusted to improve the estimated values. For instance, the method of imputation can be changed to a Bayesian linear regression of multilevel model if this would be more appropriate for your data. It may also be more appropriate to create more imputed datasets, if there is a high level of missingness in the data \n\nWhite et al., 2011. MICE has been thoroughly developed and implemented in R. It is even easy to pool the results of downstream analyses, by fitting a model to each of the imputed datasets and then combining the results together.\n\nUsing MICE in python is also available, but is an experimental feature available in \n\nscikit-learn, via the IterativeImputer class:# explicitly require this experimental feature to use IterativeImputer\nfrom sklearn.experimental import enable_iterative_imputer  \n# now you can import normally from sklearn.impute\nfrom sklearn.impute import IterativeImputer\n\n# Remap \"Blood Test Result\" column, so it is expressed as a number and is compatible with IterativeImputer\ndf_fictional_dataset['Blood Test Result'] = df_fictional_dataset['Blood Test Result'].replace({'Negative': 0, > 'Positive': 1})\n\n# initialize the imputer\nimp = IterativeImputer(max_iter=50, random_state=500, sample_posterior=True, keep_empty_features=False) \n# train and fit the imputer in one step\nimputed_values = imp.fit_transform(df_fictional_dataset)\n\n# instantiate dataframe by copying original\ndf_imputed_dataset = df_fictional_dataset.copy()\n# replace values in dataframe based on fit_transform output\ndf_imputed_dataset.iloc[:, :] = imputed_values\n\n\nwhich gives us:\n\nParticipant Number\n\nAge\n\nDiastolic Blood Pressure\n\nSystolic Blood Pressure\n\nBlood Test Result\n\nMotor Score\n\nCognitive Score\n\n1\n\n56\n\n82\n\n118\n\nPositive\n\n10\n\n35\n\n2\n\n78\n\n87\n\n134\n\nPositive\n\n32\n\n29\n\n3\n\n85\n\n85\n\n155\n\nPositive\n\n27\n\n23\n\n4\n\n43\n\n83\n\n121\n\n0\n\n15\n\n36\n\n5\n\n67\n\n86\n\n131\n\n1\n\n20\n\n25\n\n6\n\n82\n\n92\n\n133\n\n0\n\n26\n\n91\n\n7\n\n88\n\n107\n\n157\n\n1\n\n34\n\n30\n\n8\n\n71\n\n64\n\n127\n\n0\n\n33\n\n22\n\nThe IterativeImputer class allows for both univariate and multivariate imputations and encompasses many different imputation methods (function parameters specify which is being used). The training step of the imputer can also be done separately to fitting (by using the \n\nimp.fit function first, and then imp.transform). This means that the training dataset can also be different to what is then provided to be imputed.\n\nIn the example above, we are showing the results from one MICE cycle. In order to obtain several cycle results (or multiple imputed values), then you need to manually apply it several times with different random seeds when sample_posterior=True. This is not shown here for brevity.-\n> The first step of a cycle involves filling in the missing values in the variable with the least number of missing values using regression. A different type of regression can be used for each variable, such that each variable is handled separately and can be assigned a unique distribution. This imputation also includes some randomness to capture the uncertainty of the imputed value. Next, the variable with the 2nd least number of missing values is imputed, and so on. This is done iteratively, even after all missing values have been imputed. At the end of a set number of iterations over all variables (e.g. 10), the cycle is complete and each missing value now has an unbiased imputed value. \n-\nAn extension of imputation is interpolation, which estimates data points based on a known range of values. \n (pd-missing-data-methods-model)=\n## Model-Based\n\nModel-based methods (such as those in the figure above under the \"Imputation\" heading) can also be used to handle missing data, without imputing missing values.

SM arises in data that is MCAR, MAR or MNAR, and whose missingness has some structure or pattern \n\nMitra et al., 2023. Specifically, standard definitions of missinginess mechanisms (such as those introduced in \n\nMissing Data Structures) assume that the missingness of one variable is independent of the missingness in another, when conditioning on the relevant data. In contrast, the missingness of a variable can depend on the data and the missingness of other variables in SM \n\nJackson et al., 2023.\n\nThis is common in research contexts where data is combined from multiple studies or sources. For instance, many large-scale healthcare studies are multimodal and attempt to include a diverse set of patients, therefore capturing data for a heterogeneous group of individuals. Therefore, data is often collected at multiple time points and multiple sites, where different measurements may be taken, such as clinical, genomic or imaging measures. Our example dataset (introduced in \n\nMissing Data Structures) is also an example of SM.\n\nExample: The missing values in the blood test results, blood pressure readings, and cognitive scores are all examples of SM. The blood test results (MCAR) are due to batch failure. The cognitive score missing values (MNAR) are missing in participants with significant cognitive decline. The blood pressure readings (MAR) are missing in participants that could not attend the clinic due to being older and having more motor dysfunction. Therefore, the missingness in all these variables are not equally likely for all individuals, even after conditioning on the relevant data. The missingness has some information that can be leveraged in further analyses and this would be also considered as SM.\n\nMoreover, the missingness present here is directly related to digital health equity and fairness, as certain participants were unable to attend due to differences in accessibility. Therefore, this example also demonstrates potential ethical consequences and importance of analysing data missingness by interrogating the missingness structure or patterns.\n\nParticipant Number\n\nAge\n\nDiastolic Blood Pressure\n\nSystolic Blood Pressure\n\nBlood Test Result\n\nMotor Score\n\nCognitive Score\n\n1\n\n56\n\n82\n\n118\n\nN/A\n\n10\n\n35\n\n2\n\n78\n\n87\n\n134\n\nN/A\n\n32\n\n29\n\n3\n\n85\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n27\n\nN/A\n\n4\n\n43\n\n83\n\n121\n\nNegative\n\n15\n\n36\n\n5\n\n67\n\n86\n\n131\n\nPositive\n\n20\n\n25\n\n6\n\n82\n\n92\n\n133\n\nNegative\n\n26\n\nN/A\n\n7\n\n88\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nPositive\n\n34\n\nN/A\n\n8\n\n71\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nNegative\n\n33\n\n22\n\nNot all forms of structured missingness can have the same consequences on data. For instance, a complete case analysis may have bias introduced due to the missing blood pressure readings (MAR) and cognitive score (MNAR) values, while the blood test (MCAR) values would not introduce bias, but would decrease statistical power. MAR data may introduce bias by selecting a non-representative subset of the data. This is similarly the case for MNAR, but as the mechanism behind the missingness is not apparent, handling this bias in subsequent analysis can be challenging.\n\nMany datasets, fusing data from multiple sites and modalities, do take care to follow a certain design and data collection process. However, machine learning methods perform best with large datasets. It is common practice for a machine learning model to include data from many studies, often with different designs and variables. Missing values may therefore include information in and of themselves; they may be related to sampling methodologies or reflect population characteristics. Traditional imputation methods, such as those introduced in ref{pd-missing-data-methods}, frequently are not appropriate for handling SM and do not take advantage of the information inherent in SM \n\nMitra et al., 2023. SM also has consequences for downstream analyses; if there is bias to the SM mechanisms, the fairness of the model would be in question. Further research is required to identify appropriate methods for universally handling SM and in defining SM within the MCAR, MAR, and MNAR framework \n\nJackson et al., 2023.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Overview of the structured missingness (SM) life cycle [Text adapted from: \n\nMitra et al., 2023]. A. In a given dataset, data may come from different sources and modalities. Some examples are electronic medical records (EMR), wearable devices, or social media. Data may not be collected at the same time or for the same individuals in each case, which may result in both random and SM when joining these data sources together. Researchers are working on developing tools to minimize the effects of SM on any downstream analysis. B. Unique models can be built using different combinations or portions of datasets. However, SM may affect how models learn from data and cause bias. Researchers similarly need to develop tools that handle and adapt SM appropriately. C. These models can then be used to perform analysis, inferences, and predictions. Effective data imputation can have a large impact on results. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and benchmark the consequences of data imputation.  D.  Often the end goal of a scientific exploration is to understand causality between different variables. Inferences obtained can provide the foundation for determining causality and counterfactuals, but can be compromised by the presence of SM. The SM life cycle then repeats as these insights can be used to further understand the missingness of the data.\n\nTherefore, developing tools that address SM at every step of the cycle is important so that insights and analysis is unbiased. Researchers are trying to solve these different SM challenges.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/missing-data/missing-data-structured-missingness","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Structured Missingness","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/project-design/missing-data/missing-data-structured-missingness#pd-missing-data-structured-missingness-summary","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Structured Missingness","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"SM is a new and expanding area of research that aims to improve large-scale statistical and machine learning analyses, by reducing model degradation and bias.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/missing-data/missing-data-structured-missingness#pd-missing-data-structured-missingness-summary","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Missing Data Structures"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/missing-data/missing-data-structures","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Missing Data Structures"},"content":"This subchapter introduces the main missing data structures.

Essentially any variable that affects the reason for why the data is missing in the first place has no affect on any of the variables in the study. Therefore, this means that the probability of a data entry being missing is the same for any given data point.\n\nExample: A specific batch of blood samples were incorrectly processed, so the results were discarded.

These definitions are particularly helpful in determining which data handling method to use. Simple implementations were used to demonstrate the types of missingness a small dataset of health outcomes.\n\nHowever, these are quite oversimplified and real-world datasets can be a lot more complex. For instance, whether a given participant may be unable to come into clinic or willing to continue participating in a study at a younger age/lower motor score/higher cognitive score than average. Alternatively, they may have missing data in a variable that helps explain the reason or mechanism of missingness.\n\nSeveral types of missingness may also be present in a given dataset, and sometimes multiple types may occur in one variable of interest. Therefore, handling missing data can be quite tricky. Here we directly observed the missing values by looking at the data, however this is a cumbersome and unrealistic task in many real datasets, which maybe have thousands of participants, and hundreds of variables (or more).

behaviour.\n\nOutlining the process by which problems or violations of the guidelines will be addressed and who will be in charge of enforcing the Code of Conduct.\n\nWe should also provide clear guidelines for how to process incidents if something happens, from reporting to enforcement.\nIt is very important to enforce the CoC, the only thing that is worse than not having one, is not enforcing it.\nBy prominently displaying and practising these guidelines, you can ensure that social behaviour expectations are modelled and encouraged among all participants, including the project leadership.\n\nYou can create your own CoC by using the following process:\n\nBrainstorm core words that represent community values\n\nConsider behaviours to encourage/discourage\n\nThink through the process for enforcement, incident reporting & response\n\nUnderstand/accept your role as project lead and act collaboratively\n\nIt is recommended to select and adapt a well established Code of Conduct.\nMany openly developed projects have a Code of Conduct in place that often is openly licensed and can be re-used and adapted for your own project.\nThe \n\nTuring Way Code of Conduct is one example of a Code of Conduct built on various existing ones and can be adapted further.\n\nYou can also consult the following references and templates to get started on a code of conduct for your project.\n\nopensource.guide for CoC\n\nContributor Covenant example of CoC\n\nThe Carpentries CoC\n\nCSV,Conf conference CoC\n\nPyCon

Designs motivate stakeholders and allow collaboration and inclusion.\n- I guess I wrote these as actions I wish I had done better - Not setting short- and long-term milestones, communicating and enforcing norms for collaborator engagement, delegating work and project management tasks.\n- Not having documentation besides final reports. When being asked about the code or dataset (raw and process), step by step process from preparing data to getting the results, lack of documented guidance in one place made it hard to trace the project with all team members (classic problem).\n- Not properly taking into account the degree to which requirements will change throughout a project - which happens a lot in academia - and the effect this has on designs that then also need to change.\n- Trying to plan too much at the beginning and never getting started.\n- Feeling like I am always taking an ad hoc approach to planning a project and then feeling like I am spending too much time on the organisation side of the project because I don’t have a set workflow to handle project planning and design. Also, not knowing how project planning fits into project design.\n- Using a very messy excel to store/process data, the shame!\n- Over-engineering a design for features that didn’t end up being implemented (in life before academia!)\n- Not implementing Git flow from the start, and not teaching collaborators how to use Git flow.\n- Not developing tests until after a significant amount of code was written.\n- Not doing code reviews.\n- Not defining use scenarios for the software from the beginning, meaning we didn’t pay enough attention to data input and output.\n- Agonising too long before switching to objectively better design (particularly translating from a largely functional codebase to more object-oriented).\n- Going with options that team members are ‘comfortable’ with (for example, using outdated languages or platform-dependent compilers), rather than teaching team members new skills. Makes life more difficult in the long run.\n- Defining governance at different stages of the project or potential scenario planning for how governance might change as the project scales up/down/gains new users and so on.\n- Not thinking about community from the start, starting with a Code of Conduct, thinking about a Contributor License Agreement (intellectual property), what processes will be used and how they will work, how they will impact future contributors and the overall project.\n","type":"content","url":"/project-design/pd-overview/pd-overview-repro#participation-and-contribution-process","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Collaborative project documentation","lvl3":"Preparing for Change","lvl2":"Participation and contribution process"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/project-design/pd-overview/pd-overview-repro#preparing-for-change","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Collaborative project documentation","lvl3":"Preparing for Change","lvl2":"Participation and contribution process"},"content":"I work alone, do I need to think about project design?\n\nThe short answer is ‘yes’.\nThe project design will allow you to manage your work well for yourself (see the section: \n\nGetting Started Checklist).\n\nA little work and time investment early on in project design saves a lot of time later when any circumstances arise that demand change.\n\nIt is really hard for a project to move from practices that were designed for one person to practices that work for a team.\nTherefore, it is essential to document and use practices that will enable collaboration if and when you have to involve others in your project.\nConsidering good team practices even for a project run by an individual makes it easy for them to effectively accomplish their goals.\nFor example, you can define goals in your project and identify tasks by asking questions like:\nhow can my work be split, how will it be reviewed, how will decisions be made, and so on.\nLearn how \n\nagile methodologies help adapt to changes.\nLearn about good team practices in our \n\nsection on teamwork.\n\nProject design does not ensure that everything will always go as planned or there will be no unexpected challenges.\nHowever, it helps you prepare in advance for risk management and to adapt to changes better.\nAlso, see \n\nThe cost of change curve in the context of Software Engineering.\n\nThis chapter summarises participants’ notes from a short workshop called “Good Practices for Designing Software Development Projects (The Turing Way)” at the \n\nCollaboration Workshop 2021 hosted by \n\nSoftware Sustainability Institute.

across different industries, including research.\nThey provide clear guidance and direction on how work should be managed effectively, and can support greater collaboration, transparent decision making, and deliberative working.\n\nResearch projects are often characterised by uncertainty, evolving objectives, and a need for flexibility.\nAs such, they require a framework that can accommodate these dynamics.\nChoosing the right project management framework for a research project is crucial, as it can significantly influence your research project’s success, efficiency, and potential for collaboration.\nAs a recent study pointed out, “a fine balance is needed between implementing management approaches to support the efficient and effective delivery of projects while not compromising accountability, creativity and innovation.” \n\nTraditional methodologies, for example Waterfall, offer a structured, linear approach beneficial for projects with well-defined stages and stable requirements, known from the beginning of the project design process.\n\nAgile frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban, are flexible and can adapt to changing research landscapes and iterative discovery processes that are part of many research projects.\n\nThere are also a number of other methodologies and philosophies that you can explore: PRINCE2, Lean, Stage/Phase Gate, and many more.\n\nThe decision between project management frameworks hinges on the nature of the research, the level of clarity in objectives, and the extent to which the project can accommodate changes in scope or direction.\nSome methodologies are better suited for flexible collaboration between distributed teams.\nBalancing these factors with team dynamics and stakeholder expectations will guide researchers in selecting a framework that aligns with their project’s goals, timeline, and complexity, ensuring a smooth and effective research process.\n\nThese pages on The Turing Way are designed

both of these are more common in warm weather, so the weather is the confounder.\nTo measure the strength of any causal relationship between exposure and outcome, the strength of the relationship between the confounder and the outcome must also be measured by including the confounder as a model input.\nIn a simple model the strength of these effects (x_1, x_2) could be estimated as:\nOutcome = x_1 \\times  Exposure  + x_2 \\times Confounder\n\nIn the study of causal inference it is common to use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to map the causal relationships between variables, which can help to identify confounders.\nThis can be helpful as it is not always clear whether a potential confounder is in fact a confounder, or a mediator, a proxy confounder, or a competing exposure.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:A directed acyclic graph (DAG), with the relationship of interest indicated in red.\n\nModelling competing exposures can help to make models more precise, but does not affect modelling bias.\nModelling mediators is only required if we wish to estimate the direct causal effect of the exposure on the outcome, rather than the more common total causal effect.\nTrue confounders are more informative than proxy confounders, but proxy confounders can offer some information when true confounders are impractical to measure.\n\nIn interventional studies, randomly assigning each participant to an exposure group helps to balance out the effects of confounders between the exposure and control groups.\nThis requires a reasonable sample size to work, as if there are very few participants then all of the participants with a specific confounder may be randomly assigned to the same exposure.\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are frequently used in medical research, and are typically required when assessing the effects of a new drug.\nWhen randomisation is not possible, known (measured) confounders can be adjusted for in data analysis, but unknown confounders will still have an impact.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/risks-of-bias/confounding-variables","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Discrimination and Bias"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/risks-of-bias/discrimination-bias","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Discrimination and Bias"},"content":"The word bias is often used to refer to prejudice against a group of people.\nWhile this differs from the statistical bias which has been the focus of this chapter, there is significant overlap between these types of bias.\nA model may act in a biased way against a group of people, which can lead to discriminatory outcomes.\n\nData science and AI will always be at risk of bias -

to cite in order to give unfair emphasis to a particular narrative.\n\nTo avoid biases in reporting research, it is helpful to define what the primary results are before conducting research, then

participating if they receive a specific treatment), and to avoid behavioural changes due to the psychological effects of receiving different treatments, such as the placebo effect.\nThis is not possible in observational research.\n\nBlinding assessors can help to avoid an information bias, where the assessment of outcome is influenced by the expectations of the exposure.\nData analysts can also be blinded to ensure a fair assessment of the final data.\n\nTypically the phrase ‘single-blind’ will refer to blinding only the participants, ‘double-blind’ to participants and assessors, and

inaccurate, uninformative, or misleading.\n\nValidations are often weak due to the use of small and potentially non-representative samples.\nWhen working with sampled data, it is essential to extract the most information possible, which often means using some of the following techniques:\n\n(Stratified) Cross-validation\n\nBootstrapping (and other variability measures)\n\nExternal validation\n\nStatistical tests (hypothesis tests)\n\nSuch methods can help to evaluate the variability and generalisability of results.\nThis is particularly useful when comparing different modelling approaches or exposures, as without measuring the variability we cannot be certain whether ‘better’ results were simply caused by random chance.\n\nIt is also important in validation to choose appropriate metrics.\nNo individual metric is able to assess all relevant aspects of performance, and as such it is far more informative to calculate several different metrics with different properties.\nThese should then all be reported on, without simply cherry-picking the ones which portray the best performance.\nIt is not always clear which metrics are most useful for a given task, so it may be useful to refer to any \n\nspecific guidance for the field.\n\nWhen working with imbalanced data, it is also important to consider the effect this has on the results.\nFor example, if a dataset contains 99% cats and 1% dogs, then a classification model can simply say everything is a cat to get 99% accuracy.\nSuch a model is completely useless, and this would be obvious if we used a balanced accuracy, which would give a score of 50%.\nSimilar effects also apply to other metrics, and these can similarly be balanced based on the data

project involving sensitive data a computing environment with restrictions on the ingress and egress of code, data and other research outputs appropriate to the level of sensitivity of the data in question.\n\nThere are a variety of TREs being used in the real world, which vary from deployable cloud infrastructure such as The Alan Turing Institute’s \n\nData Safe Haven platform, to bespoke environments hosted at a particular University or other institution with access to sensitive data.\n\nYou may find TREs also described as “Data Safe Havens” or “Secure Research Environments” or other synonymous names, since the use of such platforms is relatively new and there is no strict consensus on the terminology.\nTo learn more about what TREs are, check out \n\nthe graphic and video on this

Environments","lvl2":"Conducting research with TREs"},"content":"In general, researchers working in TREs will find that much of the same guidance for working effectively and reproducibly as outlined in the \n\nGuide for Reproducible Research section will be just as relevant as in any other computing environment.\n\nThere are however some important questions to consider when working in TREs that will affect the your development workflow for scientific code writing and data analysis:\n\n1) Does the TRE have internet access?\n\nTREs set up for researchers to work on particularly sensitive data will likely lack internet access, in order to prevent a data breach or the accidental disclosure of sensitive data outside the TRE.\nWhere this is the case, it is important to understand how the processes particular to your TRE work for things like software ingress (for important software libraries you may require) and code/data egress (to understand what, if anything, can be exported from the TRE).\nThese policies will likely be set by those managing the TRE, for example the IT department at your University.\n\n2) Does the TRE have a version control system, such as GitLab?\n\nWithout internet access, websites like GitHub are unavailable for the development of research code within TREs.\nVersion Control Systems (VCS) like Git can be useful even where access to GitHub is impossible.\nFor example, \n\nGitLab can be used for code developed within the TRE, if it’s installed in the environment.\n\nIf the TRE does not have a collaboration/VCS tool such as GitLab installed, it may be preferable to develop the research code outside the TRE, bringing it into the TRE via secure code ingress at appropriate intervals.\nTo learn more about version control, consult the \n\nChapter on Version Control.\n\n3) Do you aim to publish research carried out on sensitive data in a TRE?\n\nDeveloping research code outside the TRE, for example in a public GitHub repository, can also make publishing the research methods for TRE projects simpler.\nDeveloping code you wish to export from the TRE inside the environment carries risks.\nFor example, sensitive data could be committed to the Git repository by mistake, which is impossible when the code has been developed in a separate location.\nThe secure egress process and export policy for the TRE in question will necessarily be rigourous in proportion to the sensitivity of the data being analysed.\nIt’s therefore important to consider the time constraints associated with exporting any research outputs at the end of a project.\n\nDeveloping research code within the TRE may be more appropriate where progress is overly slowed by developing externally, such as when data access is critical for any development.\nAs such, it’s important to consider the trade-off between developing research code within the TRE and outside of it.\n\n4) Do you aim to use notebooks (such as Jupyter) for analyses carried out in TREs?\n\nNotebooks are a fantastic resource for data analysis, and this is no different in the context of working with sensitive data in a TRE.\nHowever, notebooks are a particularly risky for export from TRE. Jupyter notebook files in particular (.ipynb extension) are JSON documents that include metadata not viewable in the rendered form, which could increase the risk of sensitive data being included in any exported notebook by mistake.\nOne recommendation when preparing the output of a data analysis carried out in a notebook within a TRE for publication is to convert it to a static format such as PDF.\n\n5) Do you want those without access to the TRE to be able to run the code used in your research?\n\nAnother suggestion could be to include a small synthetic dataset alongside any published code, which any publicly available code or notebooks containing the data analysis can be run with in lieu of access to the “real” (non-synthetic data) sensitive data from the TRE.\n\nFor additional guidance on publishing the output of TRE research, see \n\nthis report on Developing and Publishing Code for Trusted Research Environments: Best Practices and Ways of Working by Ed Chalstrey.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/sdpw/trew#pd-sdpw-trew-conducting","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/stakeholders","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":""},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personas and Pathways"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personas and Pathways"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personas and Pathways","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona#pd-persona-prerequisites","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personas and Pathways","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"content":"None.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona#pd-persona-prerequisites","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personas and Pathways","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona#pd-persona-summary","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Personas and Pathways","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"A persona is a detail of an imaginary user or member, based on real-world observations and understandings of existing members or potential future members.\nIt is meaningful when paired with pathways through which these personas engage with a project.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:People sharing their ideas through direct conversations and on social media.

She praises the inclusiveness of the project and invites more industry experts to check out the resource and open issues on topics that they can contribute to or would like to learn more about.\n\nIf the personas described here do not reflect your experience, and if getting involved with The Turing Way or using its resource are challenging in any way for you, please open an issue or get in contact on our \n\nSlack channel letting us know what your persona or pathway might look like!\nThis process will not only help the The Turing Way team members in getting you onboarded, but we will be able to improve the community documents including the \n\nREADME and \n\nContributing Guidelines to make it more relatable and usable for the wider community.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-contributors#id-5-robin-a-data-scientist-in-industry","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Contributor Pathways","lvl2":"Reference:"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-contributors#reference","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Contributor Pathways","lvl2":"Reference:"},"content":"This file has remixed and reused material from the \n\nOpen Leadership Framework GitHub repository shared at the \n\nMozilla Open Leadership training, License: \n\nCC-BY-SA.-Git Log History: see the full log please see the 'blame button' or use this git command `git log --follow -p -- persona-contributors.md`-","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-contributors#reference","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Persona Creation Tool"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-creation","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Persona Creation Tool"},"content":"Persona development for a project or community is a great way for recognising who the stakeholders of that project are, why they would associate with the project, what their needs are and how those needs could be met.\nPersona creation tools can allow team members to collaborate efficiently with each other, develop a common understanding of their target audience and bring design principles into their work while ultimately creating an empathetic pathway for engagement.\n\nIn this chapter, we provide a simple step by step guide that one can use for creating different personas for their communities and projects.\nYour project-specific personas will then be useful in enhancing the pathways your members take to engage with your project, examples for which has been provided in the next subchapter.","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-creation","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Persona Creation Tool","lvl2":"Step-by-step guide for building a persona"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-creation#step-by-step-guide-for-building-a-persona","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Persona Creation Tool","lvl2":"Step-by-step guide for building a persona"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-creation#step-by-step-guide-for-building-a-persona","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Persona Creation Tool","lvl3":"Section 1: Name and Role","lvl2":"Step-by-step guide for building a persona"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/project-design/stakeholders/persona/persona-creation#section-1-name-and-role","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Persona Creation Tool","lvl3":"Section 1: Name and Role","lvl2":"Step-by-step guide for building a persona"},"content":"Start by giving your persona a real name and real role with the help of some assumed professional skills.\nThis will help you anchor them in reality.\nYou can use the random name generator website \n\nbehindthename.com to create diverse names.\n\n\n\nHand-drawn style image titled “Persona Canvas” by \n\nDESIGNBETTERBUSINESS​.COM.

By making users aware of bugs as early as possible researchers (if the project is a research project) do not waste a lot of time doing work that may need to be thrown away, which may be the case if tests are run infrequently and results are produced using faulty code.\n\nThis chapter demands a strong understanding of version control. The central concepts you will need to recall are:\n\nHow it can be used to enable people collaborating on a single project to combine their work via merging\n\nWhat merge conflicts are and the difficulties they can present\n\nWhat GitHub is and how to use it\n\nIn brief if a group of researchers are collaborating on a project it is good practice for them to use version control to keep track of their changes over time, and combine their work regularly. If they do not combine (integrate) their work regularly then when they come to do so it is likely to be very difficult as different people may have made contradictory changes.\n\nContinuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, rather than doing work in isolation and merging in large changes at infrequent intervals. In CI usually each person integrates at least daily. Each integration is verified by an automated build (usually including tests) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.\n\nThe idea is to minimize the cost of integration by making it an early consideration. Researchers can discover conflicts at the boundaries between new and existing code early, while they are still relatively easy to reconcile. Once the conflict is resolved, work can continue with confidence that the new code honours the requirements of the existing codebase. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop more rapidly.\n\nIntegrating code frequently does not, by itself, offer any guarantees about the quality of the new code or functionality. This leads us to the second aspect of CI. When a developer merges code into the main repository, automated processes build a working version of the project. Afterwards, test suites are run against the new build to check whether any bugs were introduced. If either the build or the test phase fails, the team is alerted so that they can work to fix the problem. It is easier to fix a bug in something you wrote a few minutes ago than something you wrote yesterday (or last week, or last month).\n\nBy ensuring that your code is built and tested regularly CI helps researchers to demonstrate that their code does what it claims to do, and that it does so correctly. Typically, continuous integration servers will also allow build-and-test jobs to run at specific times, so a \n\ncron job, nightly-build-and-test, can be done, as well as a build-and-test job run on-demand.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/ci/ci-options","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"What is continuous integration?","lvl2":"Some options for CI service providers, covering the most often used ones"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/ci/ci-options#some-options-for-ci-service-providers-covering-the-most-often-used-ones","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"What is continuous integration?","lvl2":"Some options for CI service providers, covering the most often used ones"},"content":"There are many CI service providers readily available, providing free access for open, public projects.

Care should also be taken to make sure the proportion of each type of test makes sense. Unit tests are typically very fast and have minimal maintenance overhead. In contrast, automated system or acceptance testing is often complex and prone to breakage. To account for this, it is often a good idea to rely heavily on unit tests, conduct a fair number of integration tests, and then back off on the number of later, more complex testing.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/ci/ci-practices#keep-the-building-and-testing-phases-fast","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Best Practices and Recommendations","lvl2":"Computational expense"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/ci/ci-practices#computational-expense","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Best Practices and Recommendations","lvl2":"Computational expense"},"content":"Some software will require significant compute resource to build and/or run.

X.\n\nHow-to guides describe the specific steps required to solve particular problems with the software in question.\nFor example, how to find research dataset A in the data archive B, using software X.\n\nExplanations aim to create understading by providing context to relevant topics for the software.\nFor example, if software X implements a \n\nquickSort algorithm to find a value in a lists of integers,\nit might be relevent to include an explanation about why that algorithm was chosen and how such algorithm operates.\n\nReference guides describe the code and how to use it.\nThey should include  descriptions of functions, fields, attributes, methods and APIs, and how to use them.\nFor example, if software X includes a function S that adds two numbers.\nA reference guide for S should describe what inputs it expects, what outputs it produces and in which cases it can or cannot be

behavior of any dependencies, from individual functions, entire libraries, to the programming language you use and how it functions in various operating systems.\nIt is natural to have assumptions to build on.\nHowever, it can become problematic when these assumptions are incorrect for a specific instance and the program carries on regardless.\nThis is what is called a ‘silent failure’.\n\nSilent failures can lead to problems down the line, likely resulting in strange and unintelligible error messages that do not have anything to do with the actual problem.\nA silent failure that stays silent will generate results that are wrong, and needs sharp eyes to be detected.\nTo make sure these things do not happen, your program needs built-in checks and balances.\nHaving good error management

input is numerical.\nWhat happens if this function is used on a bit of text?\nOr a dataframe?\nOr an open file?\n\nIn a different example, let’s imagine a data science workflow.\nAs part of this workflow, a column labeled “Age” is selected.\nWhat happens if this column does not exist?\nThe workflow plots the column “Age”, but the plot is cut off at age 100.\nWhat happens if the data contains ages over 100?\nOr if this column contains negative numbers?\n\nIn making decisions about cases like these, the first step is to be explicit about the assumptions made.\nTo identify assumptions in your code, you can ask yourself:\n\nWhat type of object/data do I expect here?\n\nWhat files need to exist for my workflow to run, and where?\n\nWhen calling a function, am I relying on default settings for arguments?\n\nWhen a function returns multiple outputs, do I ensure they are in the right order?\n\nIf you think critically, there is no end to the assumptions that you make.\nFor instance, you assume that a built-in function you use works in a specific way.\nLabeling all these assumptions would perhaps keep you busy eternally, and that is not the point of this exercise.\nInstead, try to focus on assumptions you make about the data and/or files a user puts into your workflow or

statement:if my_assumption is not TRUE:\n    do something\nelse:\n    continue\n\nIf the assumption is TRUE, nothing happens and your code executes as usual.\n\nHowever, simply the existence of this if/else block will be able to alert a user if an important condition is not met.\nIf they are trying to select a column that does not exist, for instance.\nOr if they are performing mathematical operations on pieces of text.\n\nYou can also take advantage of errors that are raised by the programming language you use.\nWe will go into that in more detail in \n\nError

expects;\n\nAbort: you can stop executing the program.\n\nAll programming languages have the option to raise an error.\nThese errors can come in different flavors.\nTwo main flavors that you will find in most programming languages are ‘warning’ and ‘error’.\nA ‘warning’ is less severe than an ‘error’; it indicates a potential problem, but does not stop the program.\nAn ‘error’ is thrown when the program needs to halt.\n\nThus, error types fit well with the different ways of dealing with unmet assumptions:\n\n\n\nError type\n\nAction\n\nRedirect\n\nNone\n\nChoose next

part is that the message is likely not informative to your user:object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\n\nYou can catch these errors in your workflow, and deal with them in the same way as you deal with unmet assumptions: redirect, report, or abort.\nRedirecting from an error has a technical term: ‘exception handling’.\nIn this case, you expect a certain error to be raised, but instead of stopping your program, you change its course.\nIn many programming languages, this is done in a try... except or try... catch block:try:\n    do_something_that_might_fail()\nexcept ErrorType:\n    do_something_else()\n\nReporting or aborting from an error can be done in the same way, but instead of using the default error, you raise your own.\nImportantly, raising a warning or error message from your own program means you have control over the quality of the message.\nAnd, contrasting most built-in errors, it can give a user instructions on how to fix it.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/code-quality/code-quality-robust#rr-code-error-handling","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Writing robust code","lvl2":"Writing good error

processing to a notebook used for data analysis, or a software library implementing your algorithms.\nRegardless of how big or small your software project is, it is important to make your code reusable.\n\nDifferent types of software have different requirements for being reusable: for a small script, having sufficient documentation might be enough, while for a mission critical software library, thorough testing might be necessary.\nAt the most basic level, all you need to do is put your code online somewhere that is likely to last a long time.\nA more elaborate approach to making your research software more reusable is by following the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) \n\nChue Hong et al., 2021.\n\nWhen we talk about making code reusable, it is useful to clarify what we mean.\nIn the \n\nTable of Definitions for Reproducibility we defined reproducible research as using the same data and the same code.\nHowever, when we talk about code re-use this can take many forms: we may want to run the exact same code (for compiled programming languages, this could even mean the exact same binary file), or we may want to modify the source code and extend it in some particular way to fit our needs.\nFreire and Chirigati \n\nFreire & Chirigati, 2018 provide a framework of different levels of reproducibility, depending on what can be modified.\nThey define the following levels of reproducibility: repeatable, re-runnable, portable, extendable and modifiable.\n\nWe can map the definitions of reproducibly on the Freire framework as follows:\n\nFreire framework\n\nDefinitions of reproducibly\n\nRepeatable\n\nReproducible (same data, same analysis)\n\nRe-runnable\n\nRobust & Replicable (same code, different data/analysis/parameters)\n\nPortable\n\nNot considered (same code/data, different environment)\n\nExtendable\n\n(partly) Generalisable\n\nModifiable\n\n(partly) Generalisable\n\nPortability was not previously considered, but for software a different environment (such as different hardware, operating system or even a fresh install on comparable hardware) may affect the ability for the software to work (for example it may affect dependencies).\n\nAlso, Generalisable encapsulates two concepts: Extendable (the ability to integrate with other software)\nand Modifiable (the ability to change part of the implementation to extend its functionality).\n\nIn the rest of this chapter we provide list of recommendations you can follow to make sure your code is reusable.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/code-reuse","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Detailed Recommendations for Code

This might be in the form of a website or a wiki. There are even language specific packages that aim to provide project templates that will render the template into a website or other form of documentation (see \n\npackagedown for R, \n\nSphinx for Python or \n\nDoxygen for C++).\n\nHost your versioned codebase somewhere accessible. There are a whole range of places to host code depending on your use case. Public GitHub/GitLab repositories are extremely common especially in open source, whereas private repositories can be used for proprietary packages (think Matlab). Even just a local git repository might be enough for your use-case.\n\nUse Continuous Integration /  Continuous Development principles and pipelines such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Travis or GitLab Runners to help with a range of testing procedures.\n\nConsider submitting your package to a central resource such as those listed above (\n\nTable 1). There are usually strict requirements needed as your code is more likely to be distributed and used (more on this later on). Often GitHub repositories are used to store both stable and “daily”/“nightly” builds of a package in addition to a central resource so that users can submit bugs an contribute to the current version, while testing experimental versions as a preview.\n\nWrite a publication. This could be in the form of a journal submission such as Numpy (in Nature!), or an abstract/paper in a conference proceeding. This allows your package to be peer-reviewed by experts in the field of intended use and might give more confidence to potential users that the package is robust.\n\nPublicize your package. If you have gotten as far as hosting and publishing your package for others to use, you can publicize it in a variety of ways to let people know about it. It used to be that getting your package into a central resource provided ample opportunity for your package to be shared, but as these resources grow this is not necessarily the case anymore. Aside from publications in journals, use social media such as Twitter, Discord and Slack, as well as Medium articles and blog posts.\n\nBuild a community. Hopefully a few collaborators will have worked together to build a package, and by thinking about how the initial developers of the packages interact with future users you might be able to build a strong community that will help improve and maintain the package going forward.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/code-reuse/code-reuse-packages#what-standards-should-be-adhered-to-when-writing-a-package","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview of writing packages","lvl3":"Get Started - use a template","lvl2":"Why write software packages?"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/reproducible-research/code-reuse/code-reuse-packages#get-started-use-a-template","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview of writing packages","lvl3":"Get Started - use a template","lvl2":"Why write software packages?"},"content":"With so many existing packages across many languages, it should be pretty easy to find good examples of packages and their published code on software repositories such as GitHub.\nLooking at the codebase can give you an idea of how to structure your own packages, but they can be a little daunting especially if they are well-established, widely used packages.\n\nAs mentioned previously, there are packages that are specifically meant to help you create your own packages.\nThese work by creating the underlying structure of a package or even simulated toy repositories that you can then customize as you see fit.\nSuch templates will often factor in locations for documentation, code commenting conventions and built-in code linting, and sub-directories for header files like you might find in the C programming language.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/code-reuse/code-reuse-packages#get-started-use-a-template","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview of writing packages","lvl3":"Walkthrough of creating a package in R","lvl2":"Why write software packages?"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/reproducible-research/code-reuse/code-reuse-packages#walkthrough-of-creating-a-package-in-r","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Overview of writing packages","lvl3":"Walkthrough of creating a package in R","lvl2":"Why write software packages?"},"content":"Let’s walk through creating a basic package in R using with some help from some specialized packages, particularly usethis and roxygen2.\nBegin by loading some go-to libraries that help package development in Rlibrary(devtools)   # various developer tools\nlibrary(usethis)    # create templates for repetitve tasks\nlibrary(roxygen2)   # automatically render documentation files from commented code\nlibrary(assertthat) # unit testing within functions\n\nCreate a skeleton directory template commonly used for R packages - will include a Description file, sub-directory for R function files, a NAMESPACE file for global package information and an .Rproj file to easily share and load local project directories.usethis::create_package(\"/RDemoPackage\")├── DESCRIPTION\n├── NAMESPACE\n├── R\n└── RDemoPackage.Rproj\n\nCreate a .R file in the R/ subdirectory and write a function to convert from degrees Celsius to Kelvin.\nNotice that we have some code comments in the preamble that will get used to render a markdown file for the documentation (we use roxygen2 for this).\n# create a function to convert degrees C to Kelvin\n\n#' Converts degrees C to Kelvin\n#'\n#' Allows the user to input temperature in degrees C and return the corresponding value in degrees Kelvin\n#'\n#' @param print_statement a logical value indicating\n#' whether to print the statement (default is \\code{TRUE})\n#'\n#' @import dplyr\n#'\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @return \\code{my_function} prints a declaration\n#' announcing itself if the parameter is \\code{TRUE}\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' celsius_to_kelvin(12)\n#'\n\ncelsius_to_kelvin <- function(temp_C) {\n  # assert value in degrees C greater than a certain amount\n  assert_that(temp_C > -89.2,\n              msg = \"The temperature in degrees C entered is lower\n              than the lowest recorded ground temperature on earth at\n              −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F; 184.0 K) at the then-Soviet Vostok Station\n              in Antarctica on 21 July 1983.

Commercial projects maintaining an open resource; Open community driven and/or non-profit projects.\nEach of these may need to make slightly different licensing choices from the beginning of their projects to be compatible with their goals.\n\nThis chapter aims to give a brief summary of relevant intellectual property laws (enough to be able to read most software, and related licenses), explain free and open source software licensing, and explain how combining software from different sources works from a legal perspective.\nDecisions about licencing made at the inception of a project can have long-lasting and significant ramifications.\nThe choices that you make about how your work is licensed shape who can and cannot legally use your work and for what purpose.\nConsequently, this chapter will feature some discussion of the ethical ramifications of licensing choices.\nIt aims to be informative about the implications of licencing choices for the use of your work but not to prescribe a specific ethic, as there are divergent schools of thought on the ethics of different licencing choices.\n\nMany of the concepts which apply to the licensing of software, data, AI/ML models, hardware and other creative works such as visuals share common attributes and concepts which will be covered here.\nWe will address the specifics of licensing each of these types of output in their own sub-chapters, as well as a separate sub-chapter on license compatibility.\n\nIntellectual property is an umbrella term that refers to a number of distinct areas of law, primarily these three:\n\nCopyright\n\nPatent\n\nTrademark\n\nWhat these have in common is the attempt to extend property rights to intangible goods, meaning their use by others can be prevented or \n\nlicensed.\nGovernments with such laws effectively create a limited grant of monopoly over these goods for their creators, and other holders of these rights.\nThis is generally done with the ostensible intent to incentivise the creation and improvement of such goods, but can in practice result in perverse incentives which fail to do so.\n\nWarning\n\nIt is important to consider that copyright, licenses, and patents are all legal concepts.\nAs such, they are subject to what the law prescribes, which may change over time and space.\nSimply put, different countries have different laws, and follow different procedures with regard to enforcing them.\nThe content provided here is broadly based on American and European law and legal traditions.\nIt might not be applicable - might even be contra indicated - or relevant in your particular context.\nHowever most nations are signatories to international treaty agreements which somewhat harmonise these laws notably the Berne Convention, the \n\nTRIPS Agreement, and others under the \n\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\nWhilst international efforts have sought to harmonize copyright enforcement, the real world is a messy place.\n\nGood legal advice is timely, specific, and given by an expert; this chapter is none of these.\nIt was written by engineers & scientists, not by lawyers, and it is a heavily simplified overview of a very complex field.\nThe intent is to give you an overview of the basics so that you will know when to check whether something you want to do has potential legal ramifications.\nDo not make any important decisions based solely on the contents of this chapter.\n\nSo do not take the descriptions provided or viewpoints shared as legal advice, they are not that.\nThis document is not intended to be used in that manner.\nConsult a legal expert to provide actual legal advice for your case.\n\nPerhaps the most relevant part of intellectual property law for software, data and other creative works is copyright.\nWe will dispense quickly with patents and trademarks here, so we can move on to the main topic of copyright.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing#rr-licensing-summary","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Licensing","lvl2":"Patents"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing#rr-licensing-patents","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Licensing","lvl2":"Patents"},"content":"The most important difference between patent and copyright to be immediately aware of is that by default all rights are retained by the author on works made public under copyright, whereas patents must be registered before their content is publicly disclosed.\nThus, if you want to patent something, you must do so prior to sharing it publicly.\nThe precise details of what constitutes a disclosure and the strictness of the application of this rule can vary by jurisdiction.\n\nPatents on processes and software rather than specific inventions are a matter of contention in US law and explicitly not recognised in EU law (at time of writing).\nUnlike copyright, you generally have to pay to register and maintain a patent.\nYou must also do so in each jurisdiction in which you want this patent to apply, though some have reciprocal agreements for recognising patents from other jurisdictions.\nTo ensure that patents held by the authors of software do not impact on the freedom to use and distribute  open software, some licenses specifically include permission to use any applicable patents (for example section 3 of the \n\nApache 2.0 license), though this cannot protect against patents held by 3rd parties. citations needed  when should you patent something and when not?

are a brand, symbol, or identifying mark associated with a project, product or service.\nTrademarks differ from the copyright & patent in that their primary function is consumer protection.\nThey

registered, but unlike patents, this can be done after they have been made public.\n\nRegistering a trademark generally comes with an administrative fee, but is not as costly as maintaining a patent.\nTrademarks generally only apply within a specific sector, as people are unlikely to confuse brands which do completely different things.\nThey can be relevant in the context of the name and

UK copyright info https://www.gov.uk/topic/intellectual-property/copyright \n\nBy default, if you make a work publicly available, you retain the copyright to that work and all rights that this gives you over it.\nAnyone wishing to re-use that work must seek to license the right to do so from you, or open themselves to the possibility of a lawsuit for infringing on your copyright.\nIrrespective of how you choose to license your work, however, there are some generally accepted exceptions to the protections of copyright that permit the re-use of works (or parts of works) without the consent of the copyright holder, under certain circumstances.\nThese are known as ‘fair use’ or ‘fair dealing’ exceptions.\nUnder the ‘fair use’ standard originating in the USA, the following criteria are considered on a case-by-case basis to decide if a use constitutes an infringement of copyright:\n\nFrom \n\n17 U.S.C § 107\n\nthe purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n\nthe nature of the copyrighted work;\n\nthe amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\nthe effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nThe ‘fair dealing’ standard, originating in British law, generally includes more explicitly enumerated exceptions but with similar intent.\nNotably disputes over what constitutes fair-use are not easily administrable and can require protracted court proceedings to settle definitively. citations needed \n\nFor anyone wishing to circulate their work and grant others the right to re-use, remix, or re-distribute that work free of charge, coming to individual licensing arrangements with everyone who might want to do this is obviously impractical.\nTo address this, there exist numerous pre-made ‘off-the-self’ licenses that you can apply to your work.\nWhich of these you choose shapes how and under what circumstances others are permitted to re-use your work without infringing on your copyright.\n\nPre-made licenses exist that are tailored to the differences between different types of works.\nFor example, there are licenses intended to be used for software and licenses intended to be used for other creative works such as images, prose (text), as well as hardware & designs.\n\nIn addition, there are now licenses tailored for machine learning or artificial intelligence models as these are comprised of several parts, including: training data, code, and model weights.\nEach of these parts may be licensed differently, and there is even some dispute as to whether model weights are subject to copyright at all under current law. citations needed \n\nThis is an area which is likely to see (by legal standards) rapid changes in the near future, given recent developments in the commercialisation of AI/ML models.\n\nThere are some general principles which apply to licenses across the different types of entity that they try to license.\nLicenses can generally be placed on a spectrum from proprietary, through permissive, to ‘share alike’ or ‘copyleft’ (the opposite of copyright).\nThis spectrum is something of an oversimplification, and there are some extensions and caveats we’ll get to later.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing#rr-licensing-copyright","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Licensing","lvl2":"What is ‘Free/Libre’ or ‘Open Source’

software?"},"content":"These same concepts developed originally in the context of software have often been applied to other creative outputs.\nConsequently, they are among the most developed and useful context for understanding the licensing of other things.\n\nSoftware that is not free (in the ‘libre’ sense defined below) is proprietary.\nSoftware that you are not allowed to copy or modify falls into this category, as does software with usage restrictions, for example, “For research use only” or “For non-commercial use only”.\n\nPermissively licensed things can generally be used by anyone for any purpose.\nA popular minimal example of this for software is known as the \n\nMIT license, for other works, \n\nCC0 the ‘public domain’ license.\nCopyleft licenses attempt to ensure that any re-distributions or derived works also remain ‘free’, the canonical example is the \n\nGPL.\nUnlike permissively licensed content, which can be modified and redistributed under a different license (including as a part of a closed and/or for profit project), copyleft content (modified or unmodified) must be distributed under the same, or a compatible license, which retains the copyleft obligation.\nIn other words if you take copyleft content, modify it, and distribute your modifications, those modifications must also be copyleft.\n\nThe concept of copyleft licenses and their first example, the GPL, originated with Richard Stallman, who founded the free-software foundation (FSF) in 1985.\nThe idea is a ‘hack’ of copyright law to use the protections that it affords to privately owned software to a software commons. citations needed \n\nThe FSF’s four fundamental freedoms of free/libre software are:\n\nFreedom 0: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.\n\nFreedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it, so it does your computing as you wish.\nAccess to the source code is a precondition for this.\n\nFreedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others in your community.\n\nFreedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.\nBy doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.\nAccess to the source code is a precondition for this.\n\nOther influential definitions of free and open source software include: The Debian project’s \n\nDebian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), and the open source initiative (OSI)'s \n\nOpen Source Definition.\nThe terms ‘Free’/‘Libre’ & ‘Open Source’ software are often used somewhat interchangeably, but have different connotations.\nThe use of ‘free software’ typically denotes a more hardline political commitment to the ideals of the free software movement, and is associated with a preference for copyleft licenses.\nThe name ‘open source’ places the emphasis on freedom 1 and could more readily be confused with the concept of ‘source available’ software, based on a naive interpretation of the name.\n‘Open source’ is associated with, if not a preference for, then a more favourable view of, permissive licenses.\n\nNote\n\nThe word ‘free’ in english does not distinguish something being monetarily free ‘gratis’ from politically free ‘libre’.\nThis is often summarised along the lines of: “free as in speech, not necessarily free as in beer”\nThus the phrase ‘libre software’ is sometimes encountered in English to succinctly distinguish the concept of software which respects your liberty from software which is finacially free to use (‘gratis’).\nThis ambiguity confusingly leads to the name ‘Freeware’ which is software that can be copied without paying anyone, but comes without source and cannot be modified.\nThe ‘free’ in ‘freeware’ is gratis but not libre.\nIt is also common to encounter the acronyms FOSS (Free and open source software) and FLOSS (Free/libre and open source software)\n\nThe FSF contends that all software should respect these freedoms and that all software which does not respect these freedoms creates an asymmetric relationship between the users and developers of that software which can readily be abused by the developers to exploit their users.\nIf developers are bad stewards of a free software projects, the friction for replacing them is lower, as all of the work put into the software does not need to be re-done.\nA ‘fork’ of the project can be made, developed and maintained by different developers whom the community of users deem a better steward.\nThis is not true of proprietary projects where the developers own the rights to the code and thus cannot be readily replaced by the community of users if they begin to abuse these users who are now held captive by switching costs.\nIt should be noted that an acrimonious project fork is quite uncommon and by no means always successful, it is the move of last resort.\nThe credible threat of a fork redresses the power balance between developers and users giving users leverage if developers make unpopular choices.\n\nCopyleft licenses are an attempt to ensure that software remains effectively under community ownership and cannot be used to make proprietary software which does not respect the four freedoms and may thus result in the abuse of its users.\nTo attempt to achieve this goal, copyleft software requires that when distributing copyleft software or in some cases derived works that you do so under the same terms as the original license.\nCreative commons ‘share-alike’ licenses attempt the same thing for other content.\nOne of the advantages of this approach is that the simplest way to redistribute your changes is often to contribute them to the ‘upstream project’ or to ‘upstream’ them.\nIf you add some features to a codebase for your own use and contribute them upstream then you get the advantage of the assistance of upstream maintainers in keeping your code up to date and working correctly with the rest of the project.\nYou don’t have to maintain your own fork and keep it up to date with the latest patches from the rest of the codebase and you don’t have to manage your own distribution.\nAll this also means that everyone else benefits from your improvements and you benefit from everyone elses’.\nBeing a good open source citizen means playing by these rules and, if you can, contributing your fixes and improvements to upstream projects; not just freeloading off of them.\n\nCopyleft licenses do not prohibit commercial use, indeed numerous companies exist which develop copyleft projects.\nMany of those generate revenue through support services instead of selling licenses, which would incentivise an unhealthy relationship with their users.\n\n\nNextcloud is an excellent example of a commercial, open source project.\nNextcloud makes use of the \n\nAGPL v3.0 a license which extends the protections of the GPL to software used over a network.\nIt gives users who interact with this software over a network, for example by using a web service, rather than run it on their own computers, the right to access a copy of the source code; which they are further free to modify and distribute as is usual for the GPL.\n\nWithin copyleft licenses, there are ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ copyleft licenses.\n‘Strong’ copyleft licenses require that combined works which contain them as a library also carry the same license but weak copyleft licenses permit their re-distribution as a library within a combined work under a different license.\nWe will define derived and combined works in the section on license compatibility where the detailed implications of the distinctions between strong & weak copyleft, and permissive licencing are explored in more practical detail.\nIt is important to note that licenses can be incompatible such that creating a combined work is highly impractical to do legally.\n\nFree\n\nProprietary\n\nCopyleft\n\nPermissive\n\nStrong\n\nWeak\n\nGPL1 CDDL2\n\nLGPL3 MPL4\n\nBSD5 MIT6

‘Ethical source’ & ‘Responsible AI’ Licenses are examples of this approach and seek to place restrictions on the uses to which the licensees can put the software or machine learning systems licensed in this fashion.\nConsequently, these licenses by the classical definitions of free and open source software from the FSF and OSI would not be considered free or open source licenses. They do however generally resemble them in the other three criteria of the definition.\nTheir merits versus conventional open source licenses have been the subject of some debate, and their adoption has thus far been relatively limited.\n\nEven an attribution requirement (the BY in CC-BY) can in some cases be considered a usage restriction.\nFor example the Debian project found the \n\nCommon Public Attribution License (CPAL) to be incompatible their free-software guidelines for this reason whilst it is approved by the Open Source Initiative.\nIn the case of academic works attribution requirements can serve to re-enforce the citation convention with the force of copyright law.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing#rr-licensing-usage-restriction","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Licensing","lvl3":"Where to find open licenses for different types of work","lvl2":"What is ‘Free/Libre’ or ‘Open Source’ software?"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing#rr-licensing-choosing","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Licensing","lvl3":"Where to find open licenses for different types of work","lvl2":"What is ‘Free/Libre’ or ‘Open Source’ software?"},"content":"Code\n\nThe \n\nOpen Source Initiaitive (OSI) maintains a list of \n\napproved licenses open source licenses\n\nFree Software Foundation maintains a \n\nlist of GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses\n\nGNU/FSF recomendations\n\nchoosealicense.com provides a tool to guide you through the license choice project.\n\nOrganisation for ethical source maintains a list of \n\nethical source licenses\n\nProse, Images, Audio, Video, Datasets, and similar\n\nCreative Commons (CC)\n\nCreative Commons License Chooser\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Creative Commons License Types.

components in your program, then you may end up with multiple different constraints on the license of the combined work.\nIf these constraints conflict, then you cannot legally distribute the result

Software"},"content":"Within the category of free software, there are several subcategories, which are distinguished by what is allowed when making derivative software.\nThere are two basic ways of making a derivative work of a program or library: modifying it (forking), or combining it with other software (for example using a library in your program).\nOf course, you can modify and then combine as well.\n\nModifying a program leads to a new program that is derived from the original.\nThis is similar to deriving the new edition of a textbook from the original.\nBoth the original and modified versions are works under copyright law, and both of them may be licensed.\n\nAs an example of combining software, imagine a program A that uses two preexisting libraries B and C.\nThe complete program A will consist of library B, library C, and some code D that connects the libraries together and perhaps adds additional functionality.\nEach of these four items is a work of authorship with a license.\nProgram A can sometimes be referred to as the “Combined work”, “Work as a whole” or “Larger work”.\n\nDifferent free software licenses place different constraints on how modified versions and combined works can be licensed.\n\nCopyleft licenses add some restrictions to the licensing of derivative works.\nLike permissive licenses, they let you distribute the software unchanged under that license.\nHowever, if you distribute a binary, then you have to include the source code as well.\nModified versions have to be distributed under the same license as the original; you are not allowed to change the license.\n\nThe GNU GPL, for instance, is incompatible with proprietary licenses, because it requires the combined work to be licensed under the GPL, with no additional restrictions allowed.\nHaving a part of the work under a proprietary license is such an additional restriction, so you cannot distribute such a combination, unless the copyright owner of the GPL code gives special permission.\nHowever, GPL codebases often have many contributors and you need all of their permission. This is an intended feature of the license which is by design hostile to being re-licensed in a proprietary fashion.\n\n\nContributor License Agreements (CLAs) can be used by GPL projects circumvent this by empowering a single party to make decisions about relicensing if they want to allow for dual licensing of GPL or AGPL codebases.\n\nWhen creating a combined work, a further distinction can be made.\nStrong copyleft licenses on a component require a combined work to be licensed under the same license as the component.\nIn the example above, if library B is distributed under a strong copyleft license such as the GNU GPL, then program A must be distributed under that same license.\n\nWeak copyleft licenses allow the combined work (A) to be distributed under any license, as long as the source for the licensed component (B) is also made available under its original license.\nThey may also require that the recipient of the combined work can re-link the modules after modifying the component.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-compatibility#rr-licensing-software-derivative","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"License Compatibility","lvl2":"Permission Overview"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-compatibility#rr-licensing-software-overview","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"License Compatibility","lvl2":"Permission Overview"},"content":"\n\nCopyleft\n\nPermissive\n\nProprietary\n\nStrong\n\nWeak\n\nUse for anything\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSometimes\n\nPrivate changes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nRarely\n\nDistribute original\n\nSame license, with source\n\nSame license, with source\n\nSame license, also binary-only1\n\nRarely\n\nDistribute modified\n\nSame license, with source\n\nSame license, with source2\n\nAny license, also binary-only\n\nRarely\n\nDistribute combined\n\nSame license, with source\n\nAny license, binary additions\n\nAny license, also binary-only\n\nRarely\n\nWhen you use different pieces of software together to solve a problem, and want to distribute the result, here are the questions you have to answer:\n\nWhich separate works are there, and what is derived from what?\n\nCan the derivative works be distributed?

Source’"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ethical-source","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"‘Ethical Source’"},"content":"The ethical source movement seeks to affirmatively protect specific user rights by curtailing freedom 0, the freedom to use software ‘for any purpose’ and prohibiting the use of the software for unethical purposes.\nConsequently, these licenses by the classical definitions of free and open source software from the FSF and OSI would not be considered free or open source licenses.\nEthical Source licenses do generally resemble conventional free/libre and open source in the other three criteria of the definition.\nTheir merits versus conventional open source licenses has been the subject of some debate, and their adoption has thus far been relatively limited.\n\nA leading figure in this movement is Coraline Ada Ehmke creator of the \n\nContributor Covenant, the \n\nHippocratic License, and the founder in 2020 of the \n\nOrganisation for Ethical Source.\nIn the words of its advocates, \n\nEthical Source was created to “empower developers, giving us the freedom and agency to ensure that our work is being used for social good and in service of human rights.”\nMotivated by the growing use of open source software for technologies such as mass surveillance and racial profiling, the movement aims to reduce this “misuse” of open source software.\n\nEthical Source extends upon the principles of open source to provide developers additional means to ensure their work is used for applications aligned with ethical values important to them like:\n\nAdvocating for workers’ rights and human rights\n\nEnsuring protections against violence and discrimination\n\nProtecting privacy\n\nA list of Ethical Licenses and their targeted applications can be found on the \n\nEthical Source website.\nThe core Hippocratic license, for example, prohibits a variety of human rights abuses and mandates equal pay for equal work.\nIt can be further extended using \n\ntheir license building tool with modules covering:\n\nFossil Fuel Divestment\n\nEcocide\n\nExtractive Industries\n\nBoycott / Divestment / Sanctions\n\nTaliban\n\nMyanmar\n\nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n\nUS Tariff Act\n\nMass Surveillance\n\nMilitary Activities\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\nMedia\n\nSocial Auditing\n\nWorkers on Board of Directors\n\nSupply Chain Transparency\n\nCopyleft\n\nLicensees are given 30 days upon notification of a violation or harm to remedy them before the license is terminated.\nThe potential difficulty of demonstrating compliance with these terms and of bringing effective legal action against any party not complying with them has attracted some skepticism about the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nWhilst many potential violators of these license terms lie outside the jurisdictional reach of courts which might enforce them, many also do business with partners which might reside within the reach of these courts.\nIf for example Thermo Fisher Scientific had been using a library licensed under the Hippocratic license, especially one using the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region module, in the software on their sequencing instruments they might have opened themselves up to liability when \n\nselling DNA testing equipment to police departments in Xinjiang and Tibet legal action against them in the US courts is more plausible than legal action against the CCP.\nThe challenge might then be one of persuading such companies to expose themselves to the liabilities associated with using software with these licenses.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ethical-source","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"‘Ethical

Source’","lvl2":"Potential Risks"},"content":"In the absence of case law deciding on license enforcement decisions for these licenses it is as yet unknown what (if any) administrative burden may be associated with demonstrating compliance with ethical source and RAIL licenses.\nWhilst unlikely for any given user of software licensed in this fashion, it is hypothetically possible that such licenses could be weaponised by bad actors seeking to impose costs on the entities using the licenses, as \n\nhas occurred before with ‘exploits’ in open licenses.\nA well-intentioned organisation using tools under such a license could theoretically be sued for not complying with the terms of these licenses and have to pay legal fees and/or incur other expenses associated with demonstrating compliance with the terms, depending on decisions made during the legal process.\nThese licenses, because they impose greater restrictions on their licensees, expose a greater attack surface for such bad actors.\nCompliance with the terms of conventional free software licenses is relatively easy to demonstrate.\nTo comply you can simply share the code, if you have a well managed internal code repositories this should be inexpensive.\n(If you have to comb through your git history to remove secrets you inadvisedly committed then things might get more expensive.)\nCompliance with the terms of an ethical source license may however be considerably more complex and expensive to demonstrate definitively.\nSuch cost are less likely to be weaponised against individual end users of software licensed in this fashion but rather institutions which depend on software on this kind.\nInstitutions which are either small enough have their finances seriously damaged or their operation impeded, or which are large enough to extract a monetary settlement of some kind, would be possible targets.\nIn short they suffer from the same issues as fair-use exemptions, they are not readily administrable.\n\nEven if it is not the intent of proponents of ethical source some parties may seek to use technical enforcement measures, also known as digital rights/restrictions management (DRM), to enforce the terms of ethical source licenses.\nReturning to the earlier example, if sequencing instruments being used for unlicensed purposes could be remotely disabled by their manufactures this raises some questions.\nWhat about the use of these machines with 3rd party or unlicensed components in places which cannot afford ‘official’ components but which need to use these machines for public health reasons?\nProperty rights, the ‘doctrine of first sale’, and ‘right(s) to repair’ would conventionally protect the ostensible owners of equipment from such an imposition by its original manufacturer.\nThese rights come at the expense of being able to use technical enforcement measures to police the misuse of these systems but with the benefit of protecting the freedoms to do as you will with your own property.\nTechnical enforcement measures are often brittle, what happens when your sequencer can’t phone home to check-in with the server that tells it if its license is valid, or when that server disappears because the model is no longer in its official support window?\nTechnical enforcement measures are often invasive, to avoid being circumvented they must run with the highest level of privilege on a system and this access can readily be abused to surveil users as well as creating a security weakness.\nTechnical enforcement measures are often ineffective, they can often be bypassed by technically competent users who can share their bypasses with other less technical users.\nThese measures are often more effective legally than they are technically due to the existence of ‘anti-circumvention’ laws.\nThe canonical example of an anti-circumvention law is \n\n17 U.S. Code § 1201 but many other jurisdictions have equivalent statutes as a results of treaty and trade agreements.\nThese laws criminalise bypassing such protections meaning that law abiding users must suffer the downsides of technical enforcement whilst the supposed targets, often outside the jurisdiction of would be enforcers, simply circumvent these measures and use them anyway.\nThis often permits manufactures to abuse these statues to prevent users of their products from using them in ways not in the financial interest of the original manufacturer such as by using cheaper 3rd party consumables or repairs.\nManufacturers can also leverage their ongoing access to their devices to non-consensually, (generally with the veneer of consent provided by requiring the acceptance of an end user license agreement (EULA)), spy on end users harvesting their data and extracting value from it.\nExpanded usage restrictions could create an incentive or excuse for manufactures to strengthen or expand technical enforcement measures.\nIt could be argued that they now have a greater obligation to police the use of their tools in order to demonstrate compliance with these licenses.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ethical-source#rr-licensing-ethical-risks","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Hardware

is also a copyleft license, while the Solderpad Hardware License is a permissive license.\n\nThe advantage of using the licenses developed specifically for hardware is that they try to address the peculiarities of licensing open source hardware.\nThe CERN OHL v2.0 for example address the fact that there are different elements to an open hardware project and can be used for the software parts of the open hardware project as well, though CERN itself encourages the use of dedicated open source software licenses for those

practices.\nIt is a common practice of ML developers to use open source licenses to release their ML models.\nThis is due to the fact that open source licenses have become a standard practice when it comes to the sharing of artefacts in the entire ICT space (for example, software; datasets; models; apps).\nML developers might colloquially refer to “open sourcing a model” when they make its weights (trained model parameters) available by attaching an official open source license, or any other open software or content license such as Creative Commons.\n\nHowever, open source licenses do not take the technical nature and capabilities of the ML model as a different artefact to software/source code into account, and are therefore ill-adapted to enabling a more responsible use of ML models.\n\nIn order to balance the principles from open source with a growing demand of responsible ML development, use, and access, a new branch of ML licenses called Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL) emerged in 2019 with the \n\nRAIL Initiative.\nResearch initiatives such as \n\nBigScience and companies such as \n\nHugging Face have decided to join efforts and push towards this direction along with the RAIL Initiative.\n\nResponsible AI licenses target specific concerns stemming from specific uses of an AI artefact by enacting use restrictions to mitigate potential harms associated with the use of AI-related products and services or component parts such as data, model, code, or applications.\nThe integration of use restrictions clauses into open AI licenses brings up the ability to better control the use of AI artifacts and the capacity of enforcement to the licensor of the ML model, standing up for a responsible use of the released AI artifact, in case a misuse of the model is identified.\nLicensing enforcement mechanisms are an active area of development, and work by organisations like \n\nFree Software Foundation, \n\nThe Software Freedom Law Center, \n\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy, and \n\nCreative Commons provide direction for structuring enforcement guidelines upon the discovery of a license violation.\n\nWhile RAILs are the first step towards enabling ethics-informed use restrictions, OpenRAILs take this a step further and seek to strike a balance between open access and responsible use of the licensed AI artefact.\nFor further information on the implementation of a Responsible AI License, check the material jointly provided by \n\nBigScience and RAIL

re-distribution of the licensed material, and distribution of any derivatives of it.\n\nResponsible: OpenRAIL licenses embed a specific set of restrictions for the use of the licensed AI artifact in identified critical scenarios (for example illegal or discriminatory content, misinformation).\nTo see examples of critical scenarios, see attachment A in the BigScience license in the table below.\nUse restrictions are informed by an evidence-based approach to ML development and use limitations which forces to draw a line between promoting wide access and use of ML against potential social costs stemming from harmful uses of the openly licensed AI artifact.\nTherefore, while benefiting from open access to the ML model, the user will not be able to use the model for the specified restricted scenarios.\n\nOpenRAILs require downstream adoption of at least the same use restrictions by derivatives of the AI artifact, as a means to dissuade users of derivatives of the AI artifact from misuse.\nOpenRAILs are a vehicle towards the consolidation of an informed and respectful culture of sharing AI artifacts acknowledging their limitations and the values held by the licensors of the model.\n\nIn practical terms, every RAIL or OpenRAIL license requires that the set of use restrictions included in it must also be included in subsequent re-distributions or derivative versions of the ML model.\nFor instance, all BLOOM RAIL, BigScience OpenRAIL-M, and CreativeML OpenRAIL-M include the same provisions 4.a. and 5 which require the licensee when distributing the model or derivatives of it to include -at minimum- the same use restrictions.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that RAILs and OpenRAILs should not be conceived as instruments which, due to excessive use restrictions, could hinder incremental innovation in the AI space.\nConsequently, as BigScience clarified in its BLOOM RAIL \n\nFAQ, the licensor can always at their own discretion make an exception and open some of the restrictions when a licensee justifies that the model has been expressly modified to avoid any concern and/or harm for the specific case at sight.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ml#example-openrail-m","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Licensing Machine Learning models","lvl2":"Examples of ML models

In that case, it can become tedious to write a separate\nrule for each script when only the script name changes. To simplify this\nprocess, we can let Make expand a so-called \n\ncanned\nrecipe.\n\nTo follow along, switch to the canned branch:$ make clean\n$ git stash --all        # note the '--all' flag so we also stash the Makefile\n$ git checkout canned\n\nOn this branch you’ll notice that there is a new script in the scripts\ndirectory called generate_qqplot.py. This script works similarly to the\ngenerate_histogram.py script (it has the same command line syntax), but it\ngenerates a \n\nQQ-plot. The\nreport.tex file has also been updated to incorporate these plots.\n\nAfter switching to the canned branch there will be a Makefile in the\nrepository that contains a separate rule for generating the QQ-plots. This\nMakefile looks like this:# Makefile for analysis report\n#\n\nALL_CSV = $(wildcard data/*.csv)\nDATA = $(filter-out $(wildcard data/input_file_*.csv),$(ALL_CSV))\nHISTOGRAMS = $(patsubst data/%.csv,output/figure_%.png,$(DATA))\nQQPLOTS = $(patsubst data/%.csv,output/qqplot_%.png,$(DATA))\n\n.PHONY: all clean\n\nall: output/report.pdf\n\n$(HISTOGRAMS): output/histogram_%.png: data/%.csv scripts/generate_histogram.py\n\tpython scripts/generate_histogram.py -i $< -o $@\n\n$(QQPLOTS): output/qqplot_%.png: data/%.csv scripts/generate_qqplot.py\n\tpython scripts/generate_qqplot.py -i $< -o $@\n\noutput/report.pdf: report/report.tex $(FIGURES)\n\tcd report/ && pdflatex report.tex && mv report.pdf ../$@\n\nclean:\n\trm -f output/report.pdf\n\trm -f $(HISTOGRAMS) $(QQPLOTS)\n\nYou’ll notice that the rules for histograms and QQ-plots are very similar.\n\nAs the number of scripts that you want to run on your data grows, this may\nlead to a large number of rules in the Makefile that are almost exactly the\nsame. We can simplify this by creating a \n\ncanned\nrecipe\nthat takes both the name of the script and the name of the genre as input:define run-script-on-data\noutput/$(1)_$(2).png: data/$(2).csv scripts/generate_$(1).py\n\tpython scripts/generate_$(1).py -i $$< -o $$@\nendef\n\nNote that in this recipe we use $(1) for either histogram or\nqqplot and $(2) for the genre. These correspond to the expected\nfunction arguments to the run-script-on-data canned recipe. Also, notice\nthat we use $$< and $$@ in the actual recipe, with two $ symbols\nfor escaping. To actually create all the targets, we need a line that calls\nthis canned recipe.  In our case, we use a double for loop over the genres and\nthe scripts:$(foreach genre,$(GENRES),\\\n\t$(foreach script,$(SCRIPTS),\\\n\t\t$(eval $(call run-script-on-data,$(script),$(genre))) \\\n\t) \\\n)\n\nIn these lines the \\ character is used for continuing long lines.\n\nThe full Makefile then becomes:# Makefile for analysis report\n#\n\nALL_CSV = $(wildcard data/*.csv)\nDATA = $(filter-out $(wildcard data/input_file_*.csv),$(ALL_CSV))\nHISTOGRAMS = $(patsubst %,output/histogram_%.png,$(GENRES))\nQQPLOTS = $(patsubst %,output/qqplot_%.png,$(GENRES))\n\nGENRES = $(patsubst data/%.csv,%,$(DATA))\nSCRIPTS = histogram qqplot\n\n.PHONY: all clean\n\nall: output/report.pdf\n\ndefine run-script-on-data\noutput/$(1)_$(2).png: data/$(2).csv scripts/generate_$(1).py\n\tpython scripts/generate_$(1).py -i $$< -o $$@\nendef\n\n$(foreach genre,$(GENRES),\\\n\t$(foreach script,$(SCRIPTS),\\\n\t\t$(eval $(call run-script-on-data,$(script),$(genre)))\\\n\t)\\\n)\n\noutput/report.pdf: report/report.tex $(HISTOGRAMS) $(QQPLOTS)\n\tcd report/ && pdflatex report.tex && mv report.pdf ../$@\n\nclean:\n\trm -f output/report.pdf\n\trm -f $(HISTOGRAMS) $(QQPLOTS)\n\nNote that we’ve added a SCRIPTS variable with the histogram and\nqqplot names.

This happens because the\nCSV file uses an escape character \\ for movie names that have commas in\nthem and the CSV readers don’t automatically detect this variation in the CSV\nformat.  It turns out that this is quite a common issue for data scientists:\nCSV files are often messy and use an uncommon dialect: such as strange delimiters and\nuncommon quote characters.  Collectively, data scientists waste quite\nsome time on these data wrangling issues where manual intervention is needed.\nBut this problem is also not that easy to solve: to a computer a CSV file is\nsimply a long string of characters and every dialect will give you some\ntable, so how do we determine the dialect accurately in general?\n\nRecently, researchers from the Alan Turing Institute have presented a method\nthat achieves 97% accuracy on a large corpus of CSV files, with an improvement\nof 21% over existing approaches on non-standard CSV files. This research was\nmade reproducible through the use of Make and is available through an online\nrepository:\n\n\nhttps://​github​.com​/alan​-turing​-institute​/CSV​_Wrangling.\n\nBelow we will briefly describe what the Makefile for such a project looks\nlike.  For the complete file, please see the repository. The Makefile consists\nof several sections:\n\nData collection: because the data is collected from public sources, the\nrepository contains a Python script that allows anyone to download the data\nthrough a simple make data command.\n\nAll the figures, tables, and constants used in the paper are generated\nbased on the results from the experiments. To make it easy to recreate all\nresults of a certain type, .PHONY targets are included that depend on\nall results of that type (so you could run make figures). The rules for\nthese outputs follow the same pattern as those for the figures in the\ntutorial above.  Tables are created as LaTeX files so they can be directly\nincluded in the LaTeX source for the manuscript.\n\nThe rules for the detection results follow a specific signature:$(OUT_DETECT)/out_sniffer_%.json: $(OUT_PREPROCESS)/all_files_%.txt\n\tpython $(SCRIPT_DIR)/run_detector.py sniffer $(DETECTOR_OPTS) $< $@\n\nThe % symbol is used to create outputs for both sources of CSV files\nwith a single rule in \n\nPattern Rules and the rule\nuses in \n\nAutomatic Variables. to extract the input and\noutput filenames.\n\nSome of the cleaning rules will remove output files that take a while to\ncreate.  Therefore, these depend on a special check_clean target that\nasks the user to confirm before proceeding:check_clean:\n\t@echo -n \"Are you sure? [y/N]\" && read ans && [ $$ans == y ]\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this file was not created in one go, but was\nconstructed iteratively. The Makefile started as a way to run several dialect\ndetection methods on a collection of input files and gradually grew to include\nthe creation of figures and tables from the result files. Thus the advice for\nusing Make for reproducibility is to start small and start early.\n\nThe published Makefile in the repository does not contain the paper, but this\nis included in the internal Makefile and follows the same structure as the\nreport.pdf file in the tutorial above. This proved especially useful for\ncollaboration as only a single repository needed to be shared that contains\nthe code, the results, and the manuscript.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/make/make-casestudy","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Debugging Makefiles"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/make/make-debugging","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Debugging Makefiles"},"content":"When writing a Makefile, it can sometimes be useful to be able to see the\nvalues of variables to catch mistakes or bugs in the Makefile. To facilitate\nthis, Make contains two commands: info and error, and there is a debug\nmode to Make.\n\nWith the info command you can print the current value of a variable to\nstdout, while Make is processing the file. For instance, in the Makefile above\nyou could add:$(info $$DATA = $(DATA))\n\nThis will print DATA = data/action.csv ... data/western.csv.\n\nWith the error command you can stop the execution of Make at a certain\npoint in the Makefile. This is useful when you want to print the value of a\nvariable and not run Make any further:$(error $$DATA = $(DATA))\n\nFinally, you can also debug the Makefile by running Make with the debug flag:\nmake -d. This will print all the rules (including built-in ones) that Make\ntries for each of the targets, and whether or not a rule needs to be run.\n\nIf you only want to print the rules that Make will run and not actually run\nthem, you can use make -n.

We have three rules, two\nfor the figures and one for the report. Let’s look at the rule for\noutput/figure_1.png first. This rule has the target\noutput/figure_1.png that has two prerequisites: data/input_file_1.csv\nand scripts/generate_histogram.py. By giving the output file these\nprerequisites it will be updated if either of these files changes. This is one\nof the reasons why Make was created: to update output files when source files\nchange.\n\nYou’ll notice that the recipe line calls Python with the script name and uses\ncommand line flags (-i and -o) to mark the input and output of the\nscript. This isn’t a requirement for using Make, but it makes it easy to see\nwhich file is an input to the script and which is an output.\n\nThe rule for the PDF report is very similar, but it has three prerequisites\n(the LaTeX source and both figures). Notice that the recipe changes the\nworking directory before calling LaTeX and also moves the generated PDF to the\noutput directory. We’re doing this to keep the LaTeX intermediate files in the\nreport directory. However, it’s important to distinguish the above rule from\nthe following:# don't do this\noutput/report.pdf: report/report.tex output/figure_1.png output/figure_2.png\n\tcd report/\n\tpdflatex report.tex\n\tmv report.pdf ../output/report.pdf\n\nThis rule places the three commands on separate lines. However, Make\nexecutes each line independently in a separate subshell, so changing the\nworking directory in the first line has no effect on the second, and a failure\nin the second line won’t stop the third line from being executed. Therefore,\nwe combine the three commands in a single recipe above.\n\nThis is what the dependency tree looks like for this Makefile:\n\n\n\n\nThe dependency graph for our first Makefile, created using \n\nmakefile2graph .

We could stick with\nthis if we wanted to, but there are a few improvements we can make:\n\nWe now have to explicitly call make output/report.pdf if we want to\nmake the report.\n\nWe have no way to clean up and start fresh.\n\nLet’s remedy this by adding two new targets: all and clean. In your\neditor, change the Makefile contents to add the all and clean rules as\nfollows:# Makefile for analysis report\n\nall: output/report.pdf\n\noutput/figure_1.png: data/input_file_1.csv scripts/generate_histogram.py\n\tpython scripts/generate_histogram.py -i data/input_file_1.csv -o output/figure_1.png\n\noutput/figure_2.png: data/input_file_2.csv scripts/generate_histogram.py\n\tpython scripts/generate_histogram.py -i data/input_file_2.csv -o output/figure_2.png\n\noutput/report.pdf: report/report.tex output/figure_1.png output/figure_2.png\n\tcd report/ && pdflatex report.tex && mv report.pdf ../output/report.pdf\n\nclean:\n\trm -f output/report.pdf\n\trm -f output/figure_*.png\n\nNote that we’ve added the all target to the top of the file. We do this\nbecause Make executes the first target when no explicit target is given.  So\nyou can now type make on the command line and it would do the same as\nmake all.  Also, note that we’ve only added the report as the prerequisite\nof all because that’s our desired output and the other rules help to build\nthat output.

Note that we use both the $( ... ) syntax for functions and\nvariables. Finally, we’ll use the DATA variable to create a FIGURES\nvariable with the desired output:FIGURES = $(patsubst data/%.csv,output/figure_%.png,$(DATA))\n\nHere we’ve used the\n\n\npatsubst\nfunction to transform the input in the DATA variable (that follows the\ndata/{genre}.csv pattern) to the desired output filenames (using the\noutput/figure_{genre}.png pattern).

Such a pattern rule is slightly\ndifferent from the one we saw before because it uses two : symbols. It is\ncalled a \n\nstatic pattern\nrule.\n\nOf course we have to update the report.pdf rule as well:output/report.pdf: report/report.tex $(FIGURES)\n\tcd report/ && pdflatex report.tex && mv report.pdf ../$@\n\nand the clean rule:clean:\n\trm -f output/report.pdf\n\trm -f $(FIGURES)\n\nIf you run this Makefile, it will need to build 28 figures.

If the file with the table is called mytable.tex, this command\ncan insert it into your manuscript:\\begin{table}\n\\input{mytable}\n\\end{table}\n\nAn alternative is to make use of variables.\nInstead of creating a table in a separate file, you can write a table skeleton\nand populate it with variables.\nThe results you compute are associated with the variables, and once your\nmanuscript is compiled, variables are exchanged for real numerical results.\nHere is how such a table looks like in your manuscript:\\begin{table}\n    \\begin{tabular*}{ccc}\n        \\textbf{Variable} & \\textbf{Mean}   & \\textbf{Std. deviation} \\\n        \\hline\n        Variable 1        & \\var1mean       & \\var1std                \\\n        Variable 2        & \\var2mean       & \\var2std                \\\n    \\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table}\n\nỲou may notice that \\var1mean is no standard LaTeX command: It is a variable\nthat you can define yourself!\nHow is this done?\nHave your script print the results you compute within a \\newcommand{}{}\ndefinition into a file, for example like this (simplified Python example):# this loops to data vectors of two variables (data1, data2), compute the\n# mean and standard deviation, and print the results together with the\n# variable name ('var1', 'var2')\nfor name, data in (['var1', data1], ['var2', data2]):\n    mean = np.mean(data)\n    std = np.mean(data)\n    print('\\\\newcommand{\\\\%s }{ %f }' % (name + 'mean', mean))\n    print('\\\\newcommand{\\\\%s }{ %f }' % (name + 'std', std))\n\nLet’s say the mean of the first dataset is 9.2, the definition would look like\nthis: \\newcommand{\\var1mean}{9.2}.\nNote that this example uses Python, but you can use any language or method you\nare familiar with to print definitions like this.\nWith this definition, LaTeX exchanges the table cell with \\var1mean with the\nnumeric result from the computation.\nYou can capture the definitions and write them to a file using redirection with\n>.\nIn this example, we write it to a file called results_def.texresults_def.tex: code/make_summary_stats.py\n\tpython code/make_summary_stats.py > results_def.tex\n\nAs an alternative to >, you could also redirect the results using the Unix\n\n\npipe and the\n\n\ntee command\n(python code/make_summary_stats.py | tee results_def.tex).\nThis will not only redirect the output of the script to a file, but also print\nthem into your terminal.\nThis helpful trick can help you observe whether everything works as expected\nduring the execution of your script.\n\nFinally, use the input{} command to include the new variables in your\nmanuscript and the variables in the tables:\\begin{document}\n\\input{results_def.tex}\n\nThe examples shown here are simplistic, but with a bit of thinking, you can\nmake sure to include results into your manuscript just as they are computed.\nThis helps you (no mistakes copying results to tables, yay!) and makes your\nresearch more accessible and reproducible.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/make/make-results","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Research"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/open","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Research"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Research","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/open#rr-open-prerequisites","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Research","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"content":"Prerequisite\n\nImportance\n\nNotes\n\nVersion Control\n\nHelpful\n\nExperience with GitHub is particularly useful\n\n\n\nFigure 1:The Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

It pushes for change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools. One definition of open research, \n\nas given by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is the practice of making “the primary outputs of publicly funded research results – publications and the research data – publicly accessible in a digital format with no or minimal restriction.” To achieve this openness in research, each element of the research process should:\n\nBe publicly available: It is difficult to use and benefit from knowledge hidden behind barriers such as passwords and paywalls.\n\nBe reusable: Research outputs need to be licensed appropriately, so that prospective users know any limitations on re-use.\n\nBe transparent: With appropriate metadata to provide clear statements of how research output was produced and what it contains.\n\nSchematically, the research process has the following form: data are collected and then analysed (often using software). This process may involve the use of specialist hardware. The results of the research are then published. Throughout the process, it is good practice for researchers to document their work. This can happen in notebooks or other forms of documentation. For experimental studies, Electronic Lab Notebooks are common. Open research aims to make each of these elements open:\n\nOpen Data: Documenting and sharing research data openly for re-use.\n\nOpen Source Software: Documenting research code and routines, and making them freely accessible and available.\n\nOpen Hardware: Documenting designs, materials, and other relevant information related to hardware, and making them freely accessible and available.\n\nOpen Access: Making all published outputs freely accessible for maximum use and impact.\n\nOpen Notebooks: An emerging practice, documenting and sharing the experimental process of trial and error.\n\nSee the \n\nOpen Definition for a set of principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content. The above elements are expanded upon in this chapter.\n\nOpen scholarship [\n\ndef] is a concept that extends open research further. It relates to making other aspects of scientific research open to the public, for example:\n\nOpen educational resources: Making educational resources publicly available to be re-used and modified.\n\nEquity, diversity, inclusion: Ensuring scholarship is open to anyone without barriers based on factors such as race, background, gender, and sexual orientation.\n\nCitizen science: The inclusion of members of the public in scientific research.\n\nThese elements are also discussed in detail in this chapter.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open#rr-open-summary","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Research","lvl2":"Motivation and Background"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/open#rr-open-useful","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Research","lvl2":"Motivation and Background"},"content":"There are five main schools of thought motivating open practices to benefit research:\n\nSchool\n\nBelief\n\nAim\n\nInfrastructure\n\nEfficient research depends on the available tools and applications.\n\nCreating openly available platforms, tools, and services for researchers.\n\nPragmatic\n\nKnowledge-creation could be more efficient if researchers worked together.\n\nOpening up the process of knowledge creation.\n\nMeasurement\n\nAcademic contributions today need alternative impact measurements.\n\nDeveloping an alternative metric system for research impact.\n\nDemocratic\n\nThe access to knowledge is unequally distributed.\n\nMaking knowledge freely available for everyone.\n\nPublic\n\nResearch needs to be made accessible to the public.\n\nMaking research accessible for citizens.\n\nOpen practices also benefit the researchers that propagate them.\nFor example, there is evidence \n\nMcKiernan et al. (2016) that open access articles are cited more often, as shown by the metastudy presented in the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:The relative citation rate (OA: non-OA) in 19 fields of research. This rate is defined as the mean citation rate of OA articles divided by the mean citation rate of non-OA articles. Multiple points for the same discipline indicate different estimates from the same study or estimates from several studies. (See \n\nMcKiernan et al., 2016.)\n\nAnother benefit of openness is that while research collaborations are essential to advancing knowledge, identifying and connecting with appropriate collaborators is not trivial. Open practices can make it easier for researchers to connect by increasing the discoverability and visibility of one’s work, facilitating rapid access to novel data and software resources, and creating new opportunities to interact with and contribute to ongoing communal projects.\n\nChapter Tags: This chapter is curated for the Turing Data Study Group (turing-dsg).","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open#rr-open-useful","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Access"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-access","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Access"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-access","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Access","lvl2":"What Is Open Access?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-access#rr-open-access-whatis","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Access","lvl2":"What Is Open Access?"},"content":"Disseminating and sharing scientific results has been part of research since it was established.\nThe first scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions, was established in 1665 and published letters about scientific observations and experimentations.\nThe ‘commercialisation’ of scientific publishing began in the 1940s and for many years publications, such as through a journal, conference proceedings or book, were available to the public if purchased through a subscription fee or individually.\n\nHowever, new knowledge is built by synthesizing current scholarship and then building upon it.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the Open Access [\n\ndef] movement was established, principally through the \n\nBudapest Open Access Initiative and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access.\nA quote from the Budapest Open Access Initiative sums up the objective:\n\n“We mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles...the only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited”\n\nIt has been estimated around 28% of the scholarly literature is Open Access \n\nPiwowar et al.

Processing Charge (APC) to a journal so they publish the final version of your article under an open access license, which is then permanently and freely available online for anyone.\nThe author will retain the copyright of their article, usually via a \n\nCreative Commons licence of their choice, which dictates what others can do with the article.\n\nThere can often be misconceptions around publishing in Open Access journals- as they are newer to the system they are often wrongly thought of as ‘less rigorous’ or ‘lower quality’ than the ‘traditional’ journals.\nSome researchers have also been caught up in what is referred to as ‘predatory publishing’- where they are tricked into paying an article processing charge to journals that are fraudulent and do not provide editorial processes that check articles for quality and legitimacy.\nFollowing the \n\nThink.Check.Submit guidelines can help researchers to avoid predatory journals.\n\nA criticism around gold Open Access publishing is also the cost.\nAPCs can generally be around 2000 USD or in some cases more, which can therefore be prohibitive for authors across the globe.\nSome publishers offer discounts or waivers to authors from countries classified by the World Bank as low-income economies or APCs may be covered by your funder as part of your grant.\n\nWhilst some journals are fully Open Access, meaning all the articles they publish are open and free to read, some journals are hybrid.\nThese are subscription journals that have an option for authors to pay an APC to make their content Open Access- some of the content of the journal will be behind a paywall and some will be free to read.\nWhilst publishers argue hybrid journals allow authors to publish openly in traditional journals, many (particularly funders) are critical of this model as ‘double dipping’, as publishers are being paid by authors to make their content open while simultaneously selling the journal subscription to

movement aims to provide tools and assistance to scholars to deposit and disseminate their refereed journal articles in open institutional or subject-based repositories.\nYou may choose to self-archive your work to make it more discoverable and/or after you’ve published it in a subscription journal to ensure there is an open version of your paper.\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, more than 4000 repositories were available for researchers to self-archive their publications according to the \n\nRegistry of Open Access Repositories.\nThis list features institutional repositories, subject-based or thematic repositories, and harvesters.\n\nInstitutional repositories are generally managed by research performing institutions to provide to their community a place to archive and share papers and other research outputs openly.\nResearch communities usually manage subject-based repositories, and most of the contents are related to a specific discipline.\nFinally, harvesters aggregate content from different repositories, becoming sites to perform general searches and build other value-added services.\n\nWhen deciding to self-archive your work you will need to check the copyright policy of the journal you’ve published with (also consider doing this when you are looking at which journal to submit your manuscript too).\nMany journals still require that authors transfer full copyright for publication.\nThis transfer of rights implies that authors must ask for permission to reuse their work beyond what is allowed by the applicable law unless there are some uses already granted.\nSuch granted uses may include teaching, sharing with colleagues, and self-archiving papers in repositories.\nSometimes, there are standard policies across all journals maintained by the same publishers.\n\nHowever, in general, journals have their own policies, especially when they are published on behalf of a scientific society.\nWhen looking at the conditions for self-archiving, we must identify two key issues: the version of the paper that can be deposited, and when it can be made publicly available.\n\nRegarding the version, some journals allow the dissemination of the submitted versions, also known as a preprint.\nThey also allow its replacement with the peer-reviewed version once it has been published.\nDue to the increase of policies requiring access to research results, most of the journals allow self-archiving of the accepted version of the paper, also known as the author manuscript or postprint.\nThis version is the final text following the peer review process but does not yet have publication formatting or layout applied.\nFinally, some journals do allow researchers to deposit the final published version, also known as the version of record.\n\nConcerning the moment to make the paper publicly available, many journals establish a period from its original publication - the embargo period, which can range from zero to 60 months - were making the paper publicly available is not permitted.\nSome journals include or exclude embargoes depending on the versions.\nFor instance, the accepted version could be made publicly available after publication, but the published version must wait 12 months.

To help others make and modify your hardware design, you should provide instructions for going from your design files to the working physical hardware.\nIt is good to publish annotated photographs (or video) from multiple viewpoints and at various stages of assembly.\nIf you do not have photos, posting annotated 3D renderings of your design is a good alternative.\nEither way, it is good to provide captions or text that explain what is shown in each image and why it is useful.\n\nManufacturing instructions: The manufacturing process of parts that have been made for this project should be documented as well.\nThis is specially important if they are available for purchase from only a handful of small/medium businesses.\n\nA list of required tools and associated settings, for both the software used for development and the machine tools for replication.\n\nDesign files with parts metadata, typically including the manufacturing process, the materials with dimensions, mass, and units.\nA functional overview of the project’s parts/modules can also be included.\nIdeally, your OSH project would be designed using a free and open source software application, to maximize the ability of others to view and edit it.\nIt is essential to share these original design files, in both original and accessible ready-to-view formats.\nThe type of parts can also be mentioned with unambiguous reference, between, custom parts (developed as a result of this or another project), off-the-shelf parts (like screws) or (maybe proprietary) complex modules (for example, a single board computer).\n\nSoftware and firmware: You should share any code or firmware required to operate your hardware.\nThis will allow others to use it with their hardware or modify it along with their modifications to your hardware.\nDocument the process required to build your software, including links to any dependencies (for example, third-party libraries or tools).\nIn addition, it is helpful to provide an overview of the state of the software (for example, “stable” or “beta” or “barely-working hack”).\n\nInstructions for operation and maintenance: Describe how hardware users should operate the hardware (for example how to calibrate and test it).\nIndicate any maintenance that should be done to secure a good functionality of the hardware.\n\nRepair and disposal: Indicate where or how the hardware can be repaired, and indicate how to dispose or recycle the hardware, if it is beyond repair.\n\nNote that producing documentation-quality pictures consistently requires adequate tools and setup.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-hardware#rr-open-hardware-techdoc","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Source Hardware","lvl3":"Community documentation","lvl2":"How to make hardware open source"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-hardware#community-documentation","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Source Hardware","lvl3":"Community documentation","lvl2":"How to make hardware open source"},"content":"While open hardware communities are sometimes different than open software communities, the documentation useful to grow hardware communities are similar to those for a open source project, see the  \n\nCollaborative project documentation chapter.

OSH community building","lvl3":"Community documentation","lvl2":"How to make hardware open source"},"content":"While scoping your project, it is well advised to think about the different people who may engage with your OSH (see \n\nStakeholder mapping).\nDifferent OSH projects have included different partners at varying stages of their development.\nOn top of user and contributor roles that OSH have in common with open source software, local or global hardware manufacturers may become important partners of your project.\nYou may also think early about the people who will eventually have to maintain and repair the hardware.\nTo make it easier for them, it also helps to make your hardware designs modular (splitting your hardware in modules which may have alternative designs).\nAnother specificity of hardware may be the importance of the creation of replication tutorials, workshops, seminars, or training materials, which can impact the adoption of hardware designs.\nThis is particularly relevant if the OSH is meant to be produced in Do-It-Yourself environments or as a teaching opportunity.\n\nNote\n\nEngineering culture can still be a closed one, not very welcoming to newcomers from different backgrounds.\n\nIt is therefore particularly important to Valuing Diversity and Differences in OSH \n\nValuing Diversity and Differences\n\nIt is important to decide whether, when and where you want to engage with, or build a community.\nMost OSH communities are local in comparison to open source software project.\nYou may not have the time or skills to build a community, and your project may not need a community to flourish.\nAlways be honest with your collaborators and yourself about what support they can expect.\nThe \n\nGOSH forum has been an enabler for finding collaborators for OSH and OSH-related projects.\n\nLearning from community roadblocks\n\nIt is better to keep an open attitude towards diversification and unstable features, and this does not need to be in conflict with the main project being conservative.\n\nThere should always be space for “extensions” and “plugins” to be seeded and grow in the same community as the main project.\n3rd-party plugins should be labeled as “external and unsupported by mainline development” but still encouraged.\n\nIt is good practice to build modular and extensible hardware, with documented interfaces, to be able to grow a developer community.\n\nIt is a bad idea to respond to a request for help with the following: “It is ‘open source’, if you want that to happen, you are free to work on it in your own time”.\nBe honest of what you can do, but do not be a jerk.\n\nIf the upstream developers do not have time to write enough documentation, or do not have time to review pull requests, this fact should be stated to avoid generating false expectations.\n\nBe ready to delegate (or create new spaces) if you are overwhelmed by a fast-growing community.\nOtherwise, small projects will stall, the community will be frustrated, and then become fragmented.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-hardware#considerations-for-osh-community-building","position":25},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Source Hardware","lvl2":"Sharing

recently defined it as: “scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions”.\nCitizen science offers the power of science to everyone and the power of everyone to science.\n\nBy allowing members of the public to contribute to scientific research, citizen science helps engage and invest the broader world in science.\nIt also benefits researchers by offering human resources that would not be accessible otherwise.\nExamples of this include finding ways of

Involvement"},"content":"Whilst citizen science encompasses one way of contributing to scientific research, Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) is a far more specialized form of citizen science which is particularly useful when researching health or social issues.\n\nPPI is not:\n\nParticipation: Recruitment of participants (such as for a clinical trial or survey) to contribute data to a project.\n\nEngagement: Dissemination, such as presenting at patient interest groups or writing a blog post.\n\nPPI is:\n\nInvolvement: patients and members of the public contribute at all stages of the research cycle.\n\nWhen incorporating PPI into research, researchers work with volunteers, rather than doing work about them.\nPPI volunteers are usually patients or members of the public with a particular interest in some area of research, which means that the topic is often very personal, and being involved in the research cycle can be an empowering experience.\nFor the researcher, PPI often generates unique and invaluable insights from the volunteers’ expertise which the researcher cannot always predict.\n\nIt is a good idea to consider PPI very early in a project, ideally before any grant applications or submissions for ethical approval have been written.\nPPI volunteers can help researchers in many ways, such as the following:\n\nGenerate or shape research questions.\n\nContribute to, or review, study design.\n\nHelp with grant applications or submissions to research ethics committees (particularly the lay summary).\n\nCollect data.\n\nAnalyse data.\n\nContribute to the manuscript and be listed as a co-author.\n\nDisseminate findings in plain English.\n\nOne of the most significant barriers to PPI is not knowing how to get started.\nThe UK National Institute for Health Research has its own site, \n\nINVOLVE, to help familiarise yourself with the foundations of PPI.\nAdditionally, charities related to your specific research field may be able to facilitate or support PPI; for example, \n\nCancer Research UK and \n\nParkinson’s UK have formal guides in place that provide a comprehensive overview of PPI.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-scholarship#rr-open-scholarship-involvement","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Source

Software?"},"content":"When a software is open-source [\n\ndef], anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute its source code for any purpose.\nThese permissions are enforced through an \n\nopen-source licence.\nOpen source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly.\nIn its most basic form, open-sourcing your software means putting your code online where it can be viewed and reused by others.\n\nMany of the most widely used research software is open source.\nPerhaps the paradigmatic example is the scikit-learn Python package for machine learning \n\nPedregosa et al., 2012, which, in the space of just over five years, has attracted over 500 unique contributors, 20,000 individual code contributions, and 2,500 article citations.\nProducing a comparable package using a traditional closed-source approach would likely not be feasible.\nIt would, at the very least, require a budget of tens of millions of dollars.\nWhile scikit-learn is an outlier, hundreds of other open-source packages that support much more domain-specific needs depend similarly on unsolicited community contributions; for example, the NIPY (neuroimaging in Python) group of projects in neuroimaging \n\nGorgolewski et al., 2016).\nNotably, such contributions not only result in new functionality from which the broader community can benefit, but also regularly provide their respective authors with greater community recognition, and lead to new project and employment opportunities.\n\nResearchers that make use of open-source software often make changes to them, such as adding features they need for their research, or fixing bugs.\nThey can then contribute these improvements back to the main project so the wider community can take advantage of them.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/open/open-source#rr-open-source-whatis","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Open Source Software","lvl2":"How Running and

or organizing, if you are looking for practice, there is a task for you on an open-source software project.\nFurther, open source necessitates cleaner, more maintainable code to enable collaboration between potentially thousands of people who may never meet.\nThis helps to build and maintain good coding habits.\nNot to be underestimated are the people skills you can develop on open source software projects.\nOpen source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organising teams of people, and prioritising work.\n\nAdvance your career: By definition, all of your open source work is public, and this presents opportunities:\n\nDemonstrate technical ability: Technical interviews traditionally involve working on a simulated problem that can be tackled in a set amount of time with little additional context.\nSuch simulations, by definition, are not real-world use cases, nor do they show what working with an applicant would be like.\nOpen source provides visibility into both how a candidate solves problems, and how they work with others.\nYou make a much more appealing employee if an employer can see the quality of your work and see you working with others over a long period rather than taking a chance on a single short, high-stress case which may not play to your strengths.\n\nReputation: Becoming an active member of the open source community can gain you a favourable reputation which may bolster future job prospects.\n\nMeet people with similar interests: Open source software projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years, and many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source.\n\nFind mentors and teach others: Working with others on a shared project means you will have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help.

releasing code can help other researchers provide feedback, learn and may help them in their research.\nIn fact, you will almost certainly find that publishing your code and data documentation motivates you to conduct your analyses to a higher standard.\nBeing careful about what you write down, and documenting your decisions, can also help generate new ideas for yourself and for others.\n\nMost importantly, we need to move away from a culture where publishing nothing is safer than publishing something.\nThe Turing Way is here to help you take little steps towards being more reproducible as your career progresses.\nWe don’t want anyone to feel alone, or “not good enough” as they start and continue their open research journey.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/overview/overview-barriers#rr-overview-barriers-incentives","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Barriers to

relationships are hard to publish, particularly if the results do not reproduce previously published findings.\n(That includes statistically significant findings that go in the opposite direction to already published work.)\nSimilarly, an article might be less likely to be accepted to a journal or a conference if it successfully reproduces already-published results instead of producing a new set.\nThere’s a good chance that reviewers will say “we already know this” and reject the submission.\n\nThe bias towards novelty in data science means many researchers are disincentivised from doing the work to document, test and share their code and data.\nJohn Ioannidis published an influential paper in 2005 titled “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False” \n\nIoannidis, 2005 which discusses the many factors that contribute to publication bias.\nGiven these biases, it is very likely that there is a lot of duplicated work in data science.\nToo many different researchers are asking the same question, not getting the answer they expect or want, and then not telling anyone what they have found.\n\nThis barrier is not specific to computational reproducibility as we define it in The Turing Way.\nHowever, it is a major cultural barrier to \n\ntransparent communication, and affects \n\nproject design.\nThe Turing Way community are advocating in all the places we are able, for the systemic culture change that is required to dismantle the current publication and academic credit biases towards novelty over rigour.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/overview/overview-barriers#rr-overview-barriers-publication","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Barriers to reproducibility","lvl2":"Held to

looking for differences in the implementation.\nThey may come back with new ideas on ways to analyse the data because they have been able to experiment with the work.\nThere is a risk that they then require additional changes from the authors of the submitted manuscript before it is accepted for peer review.\n\nAs we described in the \n\n\"Plead the Fifth\" section above, the solution to this challenge is to align career incentives so that doing what is best for science also benefits the individuals

the human condition to be motivated by things that are new or surprising, but as \n\ndiscussed above, this bias towards novelty causes a systematic publication bias.\n\nMore broadly, the promotion system in academia tends to reward individuals who have shown themselves to be different from others in their field.\nThat means sharing code and data to make it easy for “competitors” to do the same work ends up being discouraged by promotion and funding selection panels.\nA good example of this bias is the Nobel Prize award which only goes to a small number of researchers each year, and as such \n\n“overlooks many of its important contributors” (Ed Yong, The Atlantic, 2017).\nOne of the goals of The Turing Way is to draw attention to the misalignment of the tenure and promotion process with

variety of data sources, is large in storage volume and/or be streamed at very high temporal resolution.\nAlthough there are ways to set random seeds and take snapshots of a dataset at a particular moment in time, it can be difficult to have identical data across different runs of an analysis pipeline.\nThis is particularly relevant in the context of tools for parallel computing.\nFor example, some data such as flight tracking or internet traffic is so big that it can not be stored and must be processed as it is streamed in real time.\n\nA more common challenge for “big data” researchers is the variability of software performance across operating systems and how quickly the tools change over time.\nAn almost constantly changing ecosystem of data science technologies is available, which means reproducing results in the future is highly variable and dependent on using perfectly backwards compatible tools as they develop.\nVery often the results of statistical tests will vary depending on the configuration of the infrastructure that was used in each of the experiments, making it very hard to independently reproduce a result.\nExperiments are often dependent on random initialisation for iterative algorithms and not all software includes the ability to fix a pseudorandom number without limiting parallelisation capabilities (for example in Tensorflow).\nThese tools can require in depth technical skills which are not widely available to data scientists.\nThe \n\nApache Hadoop framework, for instance, is extremely complex to deploy data science experiments without strong software and hardware engineering knowledge.\n\nEven “standard” high performance computing, can be difficult to set up to be perfectly reproducible, particularly across different cloud computing

Track a complete history of your research\n\nReproducible research must contain a complete history and narrative (also known as \n\nProvenance) of the project planning and development process.\nThis includes information on the data, tools, methods, codes, and documentation used in the research project.\nBy storing a complete track-record of our work, we can ensure research sustainability, fair citation/acknowledgement, and usefulness of our and others’ work in our research fields.\n\n2. Facilitate collaboration and review process\n\nBy designing reproducible workflows and sharing them with the different components of our research project, we can allow others to develop an in-depth understanding of our work.\nThis encourages them to review our methods, test our code, propose useful changes and make thoughtful contributions to develop our project further.\nReproducible workflows facilitate the peer review process tremendously by allowing reviewers access to the different parts of the projects that are necessary to validate the research outcomes.\n\n3. Publish validated research and avoid misinformation\n\nLack of reproducibility is one of the major factors that lead to paper retractions (source \n\nRetraction Watch).\nThe best-known analyses of scientific literature in psychology \n\nBegley & Ellis, 2012 and cancer biology \n\nOpen Science Collaboration, 2015 found the reproducibility rates of their research output of around 40% and 10%, respectively.\nBy working reproducibly, we can develop validated research work, avoid misinformation that can limit replicability of our work and publish accurate research outputs.\nThis aspect does not only support the validity of the current work, but any future studies that are based on reproducible research \n\nLab, 2016.\n\n4. Write your papers, thesis and reports efficiently\n\nWell documented analyses help us maintain easy access to all the results generated within a project that can be written up efficiently.\nIf working in a team, collaborators can easily get recognition in terms of authorship for their contributions. Furthermore, by availing the underlying dataset and methods we can easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.\n\n5. Get credits for your work fairly\n\nApplying reproducibility practices separately on different parts of the project such as data, independently executable codes and scripts, protocols, and reports allow other researchers to test and reuse our work in their research and brings fair recognition for our work.\nResearchers who publish their work with the underlying information, get cited more often as their research outcome can be broadly replicated and trusted.\nThis fair credit system encourages researchers to further maintain reproducibility practices in their work.\n\n6. Ensure continuity of your work\n\nBy following guidelines for reproducibility, we can easily communicate our work with different stakeholders such as our supervisors, funders, reviewers, students, and potential collaborators.\nThis aspect of reproducibility increases the usefulness of our research by enabling others to easily build on our results, and re-use our research materials \n\nLab, 2016.\nThis ensures the continuity of a research idea and can even find fresh applications in other contexts.\nProgress of such projects can easily be tracked and continued - either by other researchers, or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period \n\nMarkowetz, 2015.\n\nTo learn about other benefits of working reproducibly on Open Research projects are covered in our \n\nOpen Research chapter.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/overview/overview-benefit","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Definitions"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Definitions"},"content":"The most common definition of reproducibility (and replication) was first noted by Claerbout and Karrenbach in 1992 \n\nClaerbout & Karrenbach, 1992 and has been used in computational science literature since then.\nAnother popular definition has been introduced in 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) \n\nIvie & Thain, 2018, which swapped the meaning of the terms ‘reproducible’ and ‘replicable’ compared to Claerbout and Karrenbach.\n\nThe following table contrasts both definitions \n\nHeroux et al., 2018.\n\nTerm\n\nClaerbout & Karrenbach\n\nACM\n\nReproducible\n\nAuthors provide all the necessary data and the computer codes to run the analysis again, re-creating the results.\n\n(Different team, different experimental setup.)

The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.

In practice, this is enabled by making the data and details of how it was collected freely available.\n\nStatistical reproducibility: When detailed information is provided, for example, about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, and threshold values. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Definitions","lvl2":"Table of Definitions for Reproducibility"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions-reproducibility","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Definitions","lvl2":"Table of Definitions for Reproducibility"},"content":"At The Turing Way, we define reproducible research as work that can be independently recreated from the same data and the same code that the original team used.\nReproducible is distinct from replicable, robust and generalisable as described in the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:How the Turing Way defines reproducible research\n\nThe different dimensions of reproducible research described in the matrix above have the following definitions:\n\nReproducible: A result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.\n\nReplicable: A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.\n\nRobust: A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced.\nRobust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.\n\nGeneralisable: Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results.\nNote that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results.\nThere will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question.\nGeneralisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.\n\nMore information on these definitions can be found in “Reproducibility vs. Replicability: A Brief History of a Confused Terminology” by Hans E.

Design","lvl2":"Other Tips"},"content":"Data is often collected manually, on paper.\nTo be most efficient and avoid mistakes, it is best to collect the data in the same format as it will be digitalised.\nThat is, one should design the computer-readable spreadsheet to be printed for data collection.\nThis poses some design questions, especially for information that is unique to one experiment (one paper) but may change between experiments (for example, experimentalist or temperature of the room).\nYou indeed want that information in one column, but you would like to enter it only once during data acquisition (especially on the paper version).\nOne solution is to move these columns onto a second (non-printed) page on the spreadsheet and adjust the headers and footers to enter the information on the paper version.\nOne needs to make sure the information is entered in the column during digitalisation.\n\nThe way you enter the information (that is, the way you design your headers and cell content) may be different depending on the analysis you want to perform.\nOne should still always try to be as generic and objective as possible and think about any additional analyses one may want to perform.\n\nAs an example, let us suppose you are interested in depicting if the percentage of flowers whose sepal length is longer than 6 mm is different in three iris species.\nYou may be inclined to record a true or false column is-sepal-longer-than-6cm, but this will restrict the analysis you can perform.\nA better solution is to record the length of the sepal (in mm) and automatically create the categorization later.\n\nIf you are using R, you would then plot what you wanted with:iris %>% ## the iris dataset is included in R base\n  dplyr::mutate (\"is-sepal-longer-than-6cm\" = ifelse(Sepal.Length >6, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% ## this create the new column\n  ggplot2::ggplot (aes (x=`is-sepal-longer-than-6cm` , fill= Species)) + ggplot2::geom_bar() ## this plots the data\n\nHeaders names should be chosen with care, and when it is not clear what is meant and what unit is used, you may want to add some explanation in an external document.\nYou may also share a sample spreadsheet to a colleague to receive feedback on how understandable your sheet is.\n\nAnother alternative is to add some explanations on top of the sheet in the first rows before the headers.\nBy keeping human-readable information at the top of the file, one can better understand the data that starts in the header rows.\nThis information can also help in analysing that data, making sure that the scripts ignore the explanation lines and only consider it during analysis.\nHowever, a good file with tidy columns and rows should not need extra explanation.\n\nAs for header names, the size of the headers is not an issue for computers.\nHowever, for human readability, it is better to keep it short (up to 32 characters).\n\nYou do not have to think about the order of the columns for the analysis, as it has no importance for data analysis software.\nYou can, therefore, completely optimise that parameter for the data collection step.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-spreadsheets#rr-rdm-spreadsheets-tips-design","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Organisation in Spreadsheets","lvl3":"Standard and

sorry\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\nI have worked on research data management since 2001, yes, way before this area was even considered a ‘thing’.\nI was also told that there is no career to make in research data management.\nWell, how wrong that comment was!\nFormerly seen as an intersection between service provision and IT, data management has become a first-class citizen, recognised as a research and development subject, as it should be.\nA lot of the credit for this change goes to the FAIR principles.\nLove it or hate it, FAIR is now an internationally-known lighthouse brand.\nSince we published the first article on the \n\nFAIR principles, enabling FAIR has been my focus.\n\nThe reuse of other people’s data is providing useful insights for new research questions and products, and driving new scientific discoveries.\nTo realise its potential, however, we need new mechanisms to manage the growing availability and scale of scholarly digital products, such as datasets, software, algorithms, articles.\nFAIR has been specifically designed to emphasise the machine-readability of these digital objects.\n\nWithin my group of research software and knowledge engineers, we address the grand challenges related to information science and scholarly communications, where data quality and readiness for (re)use is a prerequisite for success.\nI believe that better data means better science, and this underpins reusable research, aids scholarly publishing, and enables faster and reliable data-driven discoveries.\nAs I say in my \n\none minute video, my vision is to transform the concept of data readiness into a powerful toolkit at the researchers’ fingertips to realize FAIR data by stealth.\n\nFAIR is not a magic wand.\nThere is a lot to be done to enable and enact this transformation.\nWe need all hands on deck!\nResearchers, service providers, journal publishers, library science experts, funders and learned societies in the academic as well as the commercial and governmental settings all play a role:\nfrom providing use cases to drive policy and culture changes that motivates, rewards and credits researchers for disseminating and publishing high-quality, machine-readable data; to building tools and services, to inform, training and educate.\n\nThere are many community efforts around FAIR; keeping abreast with these is an activity in itself.\nI spend considerable time to bring my group activities (such as \n\nISA and \n\nFAIRsharing) in and under larger international umbrella organizations like \n\nGO FAIR and the \n\nRDA to interact with others, learn from them, compare and contrast efforts and build new collaborations.\nI also play leading roles, sitting on boards and chairing working groups with colleagues, because you must get your hands dirty and lead by example.\n\nIn research data management, the history is the future.\nThe one I envision is a future where scientific evidence is routinely available in a transparent, trustworthy and persistent manner to support peer-review and withstand reproducibility, to underpin new results and discoveries, and effectively drive sciences forward.\n\nMy advice: be aware, be

regardless of what their computational environment actually is.\nThey are designed to make it easier to\ntransfer projects between very different environments.\n\nIn a way, containers behave like a virtual machine. To the outside world, they look like their own complete system.\nHowever, unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system plus all the software and tools typically packaged with one, containers only contain the individual components they need in order to operate the project they contain.\nThis gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.\n\nContainers are a particularly useful way for reproducing research which relies on software to be configured in a certain way, or which makes use of libraries that vary between (or do not exist on) different systems.\nIn summary, containers are a more robust way of sharing reproducible research than package management systems or Binder because they reproduce the entire system used for the research, not just the packages explicitly used by it.\nTheir major downside is that due to their greater depth, they are conceptually more difficult to grasp and produce than many other methods of replicating computational environments.\n\nBen Corrie give a reasonably accessible overview of core concepts in \n\n‘What is a

the files used to generate containers.\nHumans do not make images; they write recipes to generate images.\nContainers are then identical copies instantiated from images.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nA recipe file a human writes contains all the steps to generate a working version of the project and its computational environment, but no actual materials.\nThink of this as a blueprint.\n\nBuilding an image takes that recipe and using it, assembles all the packages, software libraries, and configurations needed to make the full-fledged project and environment, and bundles them up in a condensed lump.\nThink of images like a piece of flat-pack furniture made using the blueprint.\n\nContainers take that image and assemble a fully working version of the project and the environment needed to run

This folder and any missing\n# directories in its path are created automatically.\nCOPY project_files/ project/\n\nThis looks complicated, but most of the lines in this example are comments (which are preceded by #'s).\nThere are only six lines of actual code.\nThe first of these is a FROM statement specifying a base image.\nAll Dockerfiles require a FROM, even if it is just FROM SCRATCH.\nAll the following commands in a Dockerfile build upon the base image to make a functioning version of the researcher’s project.\nSpecifying a version for the image (18.04 in this case) is optional.\nHowever, it is best practice as it ensures that our Dockerfile remains valid after new releases of Ubuntu, which may not include packages (or specific versions thereof) that we require later (for example python3.7).\n\nIt is worth spending time to choose an appropriate base image, as doing so can reduce the amount of work involved in writing a Dockerfile dramatically.\nFor example, a collection of images with the R programming language included in them can be found \n\nhere.\nIf a project makes use of R, it is convenient to use one of these as a base image rather than spend time writing commands in your Dockerfile to install R.\n\nThe biggest block of lines comes next.\nIt’s a series of RUN statements, which run shell commands when building the image.\nIn this block, they are used to install the software necessary to run the project. The first RUN block is a\nchain of commands of this form:RUN command_to_do_thing_1 \\\n   && command_to_do_thing_2 \\\n   && command_to_do_thing_3 \\\n   && command_to_do_thing_4\n\nIt is good practice to group related commands into a single RUN block to reduce the final size of your image by\n\n\navoiding the creation of unnecessary layers.\nWe also follow best-practice by using --no-install-recommends to \n\navoid installing unnecessary packages\nand \n\ncleaning up the apt-cache, both of which further reduce the size of Debian or Ubuntu images.\n\nAfter we have installed Python, we use another RUN statement to install a library required by our code.\n\nFinally the COPY command is used to copy the project files from the machine building the image into the image itself.\nThe syntax of this command is COPY file_to_copy location_in_container_to_copy_to.\nIn this example, all the files in the project_files directory are included in the project file in the container.\nNote that you can only copy files from the directory where the Dockerfile is located, or subdirectories within it (in the example, that is the\nproject_files subdirectory).\n\nThe ADD command has the same capabilities as COPY, but it can also be used to add files not on the machine building the image.\nFor example it can be used to include files hosted online by following ADD with a URL to the file.\nIt is good practice to use COPY, except where ADD is specifically required, as the term COPY is more explicit about what is being done.\n\nHere is what happens if a container is opened from an image called book_example, built from the example above:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the directory project has been created, and inside the project files, analysis.py and data.csv have been copied into it.\nBecause the Dockerfile already includes the software required for the project, in the image, the analysis.py script runs without installing more software.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers#rr-renv-containers-dockerfiles","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Containers","lvl3":"WORKDIR","lvl2":"Docker"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers#rr-renv-containers-dockerfiles-workdir","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Containers","lvl3":"WORKDIR","lvl2":"Docker"},"content":"This command can be used in Dockerfiles to change the current working directory.\nCommands that follow this in the Dockerfile will be applied within the new working directory unless/until another WORKDIR changes the working directory.\nWhen a container is opened with an interactive terminal, the terminal will open in the final working directory.\nHere is a simple example of a Dockerfile that uses WORKDIR, and the container it generates.# Basic setup\nFROM ubuntu\nRUN apt-get update\n\n# Make a directory called A\nRUN mkdir A\n\n# Make the working directory A\nWORKDIR A\n\n# Make two directories, one called B_1 and one called B_2\nRUN mkdir B_1\nRUN mkdir B_2\n\n\n\nDirectories B_1 and B_2 have been created within directory A.\n\nWORKDIR should be used when changing directories is necessary while building an image.\nIt may be tempting to use RUN cd directory_name instead, as this syntax will be more familiar to those that commonly work via the command line,\nbut this can lead to errors.\nAfter each RUN statement in a Dockerfile, the image is saved, and any following commands are applied to the image anew.\nAs an example, here is what happens in the above example if the WORKDIR A line is swapped\nfor RUN cd A.\n\n\n\nAll the directories have are in the top level in this case, rather than B_1 and B_2 being inside A.\nThis is because the image was restarted after the RUN cd A command and opened at the top (root) level by default, so that is where the\nmkdir B_1 and mkdir B_2 commands took effect.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers#rr-renv-containers-dockerfiles-workdir","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Containers","lvl4":"Other Commands","lvl3":"WORKDIR","lvl2":"Docker"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers#rr-renv-containers-dockerfiles-commands","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Containers","lvl4":"Other Commands","lvl3":"WORKDIR","lvl2":"Docker"},"content":"Other commands that are sometimes used in Dockerfiles include:\n\nCMD: This is used to run commands as soon as the container is opened.\nThis is different to RUN commands which are commands run as part of setting up a container.\nFor example, to have a welcome message when a container is opened from the image, CMD could be used as follows:CMD [\"echo\",\"Welcome!

good overview.\n\nVagrant environments can be packed into \n\nboxes.\nWhen using Vagrant you will most likely start from an existing box and build your environment on top of it.\nYou can browse and search for public boxes \n\nhere.\n\nAfter deploying a box, Vagrant can also use \n\nprovisioners to apply further configuration.\nThis is useful to adapt a generic box to a specific purpose, for example by installing packages.\nProvisioning can be as simple as a shell script but can also incorporate powerful configuration management tools like \n\nAnsible, \n\nPuppet and

Some case studies illustrate how it works…\n\nCase 1\n\nRichard needs to submit 100 small jobs to the department cluster, with the names of the jobs varying according to a simple pattern. This is tedious and he wants to go outside and play. Therefore, Richard decides to write a short shell script to submit all the jobs. He pauses for a few seconds and asks:\n\nHow complicated is this? It’ll only be about 1 screen of text.\n\nWhat’s if it goes wrong? The jobs won’t submit or run and I’ll get some failure emails.\n\nHere, Richard decides that both the complexity and impact of this tiny piece of software are low. Therefore, using version control and writing documentation is disproportionate right now. He decides to do a dry run by echoing the submit line to the terminal so he can give it a quick check.\n\nA few weeks later, someone else in the lab wants to do the same thing. Richard offers his script as it worked quite well for him. The goalposts have moved. Richard pauses for a few more seconds to and reassesses the risk…\n\n…5 years later, Richard’s script has evolved into a large workflow control system allowing several universities to manage complex workflows  consisting of 1000’s of jobs being submitted to a range of different compute resources. The software now has a formal project board that sets the governance and direction of the software, ensuring that it is sustainable and meets the needs of the 100s of users worldwide.\n\nCase 2...\n\nJemma has a problem with visualising some data. The usual library can’t cope with the format her data. She’s heard about Seth’s Friday afternoon project where he’s written a wrapper around this library to solve what seems to be the same problem. They have a coffee and decide to work together. During this coffee, they make some decisions about how they’re going to work successfully together- this is their risk assessment. Seth agrees to go away and improve the inline documentation and add some use case examples before sharing. Jemma agrees to set up a repository into which Seth will put the code.\n\nOver time, more people start to make use of this software, with feature requests adding complexity and changes in the underlying library causing breakages. Jemma and Seth agree that things are getting a bit risky because the impact of wrong results might cause problems with publishing results. They therefore introduce continuous integration tests and a review process to ensure things remain sustainable.\n\nThe key point of these case studies is that every piece of software has different needs to be sustainable, and these requirements can change over time. The use of version control, testing, documentation and other sustainability concepts are useful for managing risk. Using none of these tools leaves your software exposed to things going wrong, but using all of them from the outset can get in the way of innovation.\nThe risk assessment approach helps you find the right balance for now.

This is why tests are vital.\n\nHere’s a couple of illustrations exemplifying of why should write tests:\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if problems in a program are caught before research is published it can be difficult to figure out what results are contaminated and must be re-done.\nThis represents a huge loss of time and effort.\nCatching these problems as early as possible minimises the amount of work it takes to fix them, and for most researchers time is by far their most scarce resource.\nYou should not skip writing tests because you are short on time, you should write tests because you are short on time.\nResearchers cannot afford to have months or years of work go down the drain, and they can’t afford to repeatedly manually check every little detail of a program that might be hundreds or hundreds of thousands of lines long.\nWriting tests to do it for you is the time-saving option, and it’s the safe option.\n\nAs researchers write code they generally do some tests as they go along, often by adding in print statements and checking the output.\nHowever, these tests are often thrown away as soon as they pass and are no longer present to check what they were intended to check.\nIt is comparatively very little work to place these tests in functions and keep them so they can be run at any time in the future.\nThe additional labour is minimal, the time saved and safeguards provided are invaluable.\nFurther, by formalising the testing process into a suite of tests that can be run independently and automatically, you provide a much greater degree of confidence that the software behaves correctly and increase the likelihood that defects will be found.\n\nTesting also affords researchers much more peace of mind when working on/improving a project.\nAfter changing their code a researcher will want to check that their changes or fixes have not broken anything.\nProviding researchers with a fail-fast environment allows the rapid identification of failures introduced by changes to the code.\nThe alternative, of the researcher writing and running whatever small tests they have time for is far inferior to a good testing suite which can thoroughly check the code.\n\nAnother benefit of writing tests is that it typically forces a researcher to write cleaner, more modular code as such code is far easier to write tests for, leading to an improvement in code quality.\n\n\nGood quality code is far easier (and altogether more pleasant) to work with than tangled rat’s nests of code I’m sure we’ve all come across (and, let’s be honest, written).

Well, the former tests only the interactions between the units while the latter tests the entire system.\n\nTop Down is an approach to integration testing where top-level sections of the code (that themselves contain many smaller units) are tested first and lower level units are tested step by step after that.\nSo is a code can be split into the main steps A, B, and C, and each of those contain steps to complete them, and these steps may have substeps like:\n\nA\n\nA.1\n\nA.1.1\n\nA.1.2\n\nA.2\n\nB\n\nB.1\n\nB.2\n\nB.2.1\n\nB.2.2\n\nB.2.3\n\nB.3\n\nC\n\nC.1\n\nC.1.1\n\nC.1.2\n\nC.2\n\nC.2.1\n\nC.2.2\n\nSo in the top down approach the integration between sections at the top level (A, B and C) are tested, then integration between sections at the next level (for example, A.1 -> A.2) and so on.\nTesting upper level units by running all the code they contain including running lower level ones can lead to upper level tests breaking due to bugs in low level units.\nThis is undesirable, so to prevent this the lower level sections should not be run, but [test stubs][rr-testing-guidance-mocking] should be used to simulate the outputs from them.\n\nBottom Up is an approach to integration testing where integration between bottom level sections are tested first and upper-level sections step by step after that.\nAgain test stubs should be used, in this case to simulate inputs from higher level sections.\n\nSandwich/Hybrid is an approach to integration testing which is a combination of Top Down and Bottom Up approaches.\n\nWhich approach you should use will depend on which best suits the nature/structure of your project.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/testing/testing-integrationtest#integration-testing-approaches","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Integration Testing","lvl2":"Integration Testing Tips"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/testing/testing-integrationtest#integration-testing-tips","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Integration Testing","lvl2":"Integration Testing Tips"},"content":"Ensure that you have a proper Detail Design document where interactions between each unit are clearly defined.

completely on the code in question.\n\nUnit tests are essential to test the correctness of individual code components for internal consistency and correctness before they are placed in more complex

Testing"},"content":"If a researcher makes a change to a piece of code or how it is run then how can they be sure that doing so has not broken something?\nThey may run a few tests, but without testing every small piece of code individually how can they be certain?\nUnit testing gives researchers that certainty, and allows them to be confident when changing and maintaining their code.\n\nHere’s a little example.\nSay a researcher has a small function that does one simple thing (here only a single line for brevity).\nIn this example this will be raising a number to the 5th power:def take_fifth_power(x):\n  result = x * x * x * x * x\n  return result\n\nThe unit test for this function could look like this:def test_take_fifth_power():\n  assert take_fifth_power(1.5) == 7.59375\n\nSo it checks that the correct result is outputted for a given input.\nIf not the test will fail.\nThe researcher carries on with their work.\nIn the middle of it they decide to tidy up this function, multiplying the number five times like this is a bit crude.\nThey change the result = x * x * x * x * x line to result = x * 5.\nNext time they run their unit tests, this test will fail, because they just made a mistake.\nMaybe they needed a coffee, maybe their finger slipped, maybe their coworker shot them in the ear with a nerf dart and distracted them, but when they were tidying up this function they should have written result = x ** 5 not result = x * 5.\nThe failed test will flag up the mistake and it can quickly be corrected.\nIf a mistake like this went unobserved it could lead to serious errors in the researcher’s work.\n\nSo unit testing leads to more reliable code, but there are other benefits too.\nFirstly, it makes development faster by making bugs easier to find.\nLarger-scale tests which test large chunks of code (while still useful) have the disadvantage that if they fail it is difficult to pinpoint the source of the bug.\nBecause unit tests by their very definition test small pieces of code, they help developers find the cause of a bug much more quickly than higher-level tests or code with no tests at all.\nUnit tests also make fixing bugs faster and easier because they catch bugs early while the impact is limited to small individual units.\nIf bugs are not detected early via unit tests then it may be a long time before they are discovered, impacting later work that built on the faulty code.\nThis means that much more code is at risk and that fixing the bug is more time consuming.\n\nThe other major benefit of unit testing is that it strongly incentivises researchers to write modular code because modular code is far easier to write unit tests for.\nModular code is code that is broken up into manageable chunks which each accomplish simple tasks.\nThis is typically achieved by dividing the code into functions and groups of functions.\nIn contrast a script which is just one long continuous series of lines which produces a result is highly non-modular.\n\nModular code is much easier to reuse, too.\nFor example, if a researcher has an individual function that does some Useful Thing and in a future project they need to do that thing again, it is trivial to copy or import the function.\nIn contrast, if the code that does this Useful Thing is entwined with a great deal of other code in a long script it is much harder to separate it out for re-use.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/testing/testing-unittest#benefits-of-unit-testing","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Unit Testing","lvl2":"Unit Testing

frameworks have tools specifically geared towards writing and running unit tests.\n\nIsolate the development environment from the test environment.\n\nWrite test cases that are independent of each other. For example, if a unit A utilises the result supplied by another unit B, you should test unit A with a [test double][rr-testing-guidance-mocking], rather than actually calling the unit B. If you don’t do this your test failing may be due to a fault in either unit A or unit B, making the bug harder to trace.\n\nAim at covering all paths through a unit. Pay particular attention to loop conditions.\n\nIn addition to writing cases to verify the behaviour, write cases to ensure the performance of the code. For example, if a function that is supposed to add two numbers takes several minutes to run there is likely a problem.\n\nIf you find a defect in your code write a test that exposes it. Why? First, you will later be able to catch the defect if you do not fix it properly. Second, your test suite is now more comprehensive. Third, you will most probably be too lazy to write the test after you have already fixed the defect. Say a code has a simple function to classify people as either adults or children:def adult_or_child(age):\n\n  # If the age is greater or equal to 18 classify them as an adult\n  if age >= 18:\n    person_status = 'Adult'\n\n  # If the person is not an adult classify them as a child\n  else:\n    person_status = 'Child'\n\n  return person_status\n\nAnd say this code has a unit test like this:def test_adult_or_child():\n\n  # Test that an adult is correctly classified as an adult\n  assert adult_or_child(22) == 'Adult'\n\n  # Test that an child is correctly classified as a child\n  assert adult_or_child(5) == 'Child'\n\n  return\n\nThere’s a problem with this code that isn’t being tested: if a negative age is supplied it will happily classify the person as a child despite negative ages not being possible.\nThe code should throw an error in this case.\n\nSo once the bug is fixed:def adult_or_child(age):\n\n  # Check age is valid\n  if age < 0:\n    raise ValueError, 'Not possible to have a negative age'\n\n  # If the age is greater or equal to 18 classify them as an adult\n  if age >= 18:\n    person_status = 'Adult'\n\n  # If the person is not an adult classify them as a child\n  else:\n    person_status = 'Child'\n\n  return person_status\n\nGo ahead and write a test to ensure that future changes in the code can’t cause it to happen again:def test_adult_or_child():\n\n  # Test that an adult is correctly classified as an adult\n  assert adult_or_child(22) == 'Adult'\n\n  # Test that an child is correctly classified as a child\n  assert adult_or_child(5) == 'Child'\n\n  # Test that supplying an invalid age results in an error\n  with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n    adult_or_child(-10)","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/testing/testing-unittest#unit-testing-tips","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Version Control"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Version Control"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Version Control","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs#rr-vcs-prerequisites","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Version Control","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"content":"Prerequisite\n\nImportance\n\nNotes\n\nExperience with the command line\n\nHelpful\n\n\n\nRecommended Skill Level: Beginner-Intermediate","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs#rr-vcs-prerequisites","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Version Control","lvl2":"Summary"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs#rr-vcs-summary","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Version Control","lvl2":"Summary"},"content":"No matter how your group is organized, the work of many contributors needs to be managed into a single set of shared working documents.\nManagement of changes or revisions to any types of information made in a file or project is called versioning.\n\nIn particular, reproducibility requires the provision of the code and the data that was used to produce a figure.\nIn practice, data and code are modified regularly and one needs to record what was changed when, in order to provide provenance information.\nAs we will see in this chapter, version control has a lot of other advantages, which explains why most data science project are hosted on Git platforms.\n\nVersion control is an approach to record changes made in a file or set of files over time so that you and your collaborators can track their history, review any changes, and revert or go back to earlier versions.\nManagement of changes or revisions to any types of information made in a file or project is called versioning.\nFor example, when writing a paper with multiple collaborators, version control can help track what changed, who changed them, and what updates were made.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Version control, in contrast to ambiguously named files, enables easy picking between successive document versions.\nThe Turing Way project illustration by Scriberia.

reorganised into different file hierarchies, updated with new data points or modified to fix any errors.\nSometimes you might also want to experiment off different versions of the same dataset.\n\nSuch dynamic processes are excellent and beneficial for science as they ensure that data is usable and up-to-date, but they can be confusing if they are not\nadequately documented.\nIf a dataset that is the basis for computing a scientific result changes without version control, reproducibility can be threatened: results may become invalid, or scripts that are based on file names that change between versions can break.\nEspecially if original data gets replaced with new data without version control in place, the original results of the analysis may not be reproduced.\nTherefore, version controlling data and other large files in a similar way to version controlling code or manuscripts can help ensure the reproducibility of a project and capture the provenance of results;\nthat

could be adding a new function or renaming a variable.\nIf a lot of different changes to your project are all committed together, it can be hard to troubleshoot if any error appears in that version.\nFurthermore, undoing the whole commit may throw away valid and useful work.\n\nIt is good practice to specify the files to be committed, that is, adding files to the staging area by name (git add your_file_name) rather than adding everything (git add .).\nThis prevents you from unintentionally bundling different changes together.\nFor example, if you have made a change to file A while primarily working on file B, you may have forgotten this when you go to commit.\nWith git add ., file A would be brought along for the ride.\nIf there are several unrelated changes that should not be added together in a single file, git add -p your_file_name will let you interactively choose which changes to add.\nThat said, you do not necessarily need to do per-file commits when working on multiple files, but for one single problem.\nFor example, if we add a figure to this chapter here, choosing one to catch the attention of someone skimming through:\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Flipped Taj Mahal\n\ntwo files are changed:\n\nFirst, the figure file is added in the project repository.\n\nThen, a line is added in this file that references the figure, so it is displayed.\n\nSo two files are affected, but “Add figure to version control chapter” is a single, atomic unit of work, so only one commit is necessary.\n\nFinally, do not commit anything that is regenerated from other files committed in a version (unless it is something that would take hours to regenerate).\nGenerated files, such as scripts, clutter up your repository and may contain features such as timestamps that can cause annoying file conflicts (see \n\nMerging Branches in Git).\nYou can instruct Git to ignore certain files by creating a file called .gitignore and including names of the file that you do not need to store in your Git repository.\nFor example, configuration files that might change from environment to environment should be

changes are made to the same file on different branches, sometimes those changes may be incompatible.\nThis most commonly occurs in collaborative projects, but it happens in solo projects too.\nSay there is a project that contains a file with this line of code:print('hello world')\n\nSuppose one person, on their branch, decides to “pep it up” a bit and changes the line to:print('hello world!!!')\n\nwhile someone else, on another branch, decides to change it to:print('Hello World')\n\nThey continue doing work on their respective branches and eventually decide to merge.\nTheir version control software then goes through and combines their changes into a single version of the file; but, when it gets to the hello world statement, it does not know which version to use.\nThis is a merge conflict: incompatible changes have been made to the same file.\n\nWhen a merge conflict arises, it will be flagged during the merge process.\nWithin the files with conflicts, the incompatible changes will be marked so you can fix them:<<<<<<< HEAD\nprint('hello world!!!')\n=======\nprint('Hello World')\n>>>>>>> main\n\n<<<<<<<: Indicates the start of the lines that had a merge conflict.\nThe first set of lines are the lines from the file that you were trying to merge the changes into.\n\n=======: Indicates the breakpoint used for comparison.\nIt separates the changes the

editing the file to manually merge the parts of the file that Git had trouble merging.\nThis may mean discarding either your changes or someone else’s or doing a mix of the two.\nYou will also need to delete the <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> in the file.\nIn this project, the users may decide in favour of one hello world over another, or they may decide to replace the conflict with:print('Hello World!!!')\n\nOnce you have fixed the conflicts, commit the new version.\nYou have now resolved the conflict.\nIf during the process, you need a reminder of which files the conflicts are in, you can

remembering that your previous versions are safe and that you can go about fixing this issue without affecting the past versions.\nThis is why it is good practice to merge other’s changes into your

clean and focused on a single issue and involving as few files as possible.\nBefore merging, make sure you know what is in both branches.\nIf you are not the only one that has worked on the branches,

command-line interface (for example, cd my-project-folder).\nYour project folder contains all of your files, including subdirectories.\n\nWhen working on a project, you will make numerous changes to your files as you progress.\nSometimes you may need to undo changes, take another look at past versions, or compare versions.\nSaving each version individually (such as version_1.py and version_2.py) is messy and quickly becomes impractical.\n\nCommits serve as checkpoints where individual files or an entire project can be safely reverted to when necessary.\nBy making commits, you can save versions of your code and switch between them/compare them easily without cluttering up your directory.\n\nTo get started with your Git repository, run the following Git command in the terminal to create/initialise your Git repository:git init\n\nThis only needs to be done once per project.\n\nThink of the repository as a place where the history is being stored.\nWhen you first initialise a repository with git init, all of the files in your project would not be added to the Git repository as they are  untracked by Git by default.\nTherefore, the next step is to add your files to the Git repository and allow Git to track them.\n\nRun the following command to add all files in the current folder:git add .\n\nOR run the following command to add only a specific file (called ‘your_file_name’ in this example):git add your_file_name\n\nThis command puts your newly added files or any other changes into what is called the “staging” area.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:How git add and git commit works\n\nIf you are ever unsure what files have been added, what files have been changed, or what files are untracked, you can run the following to find out:git status\n\nThe next step is to

connected to the web-based clone.\nIn technical terms, the web-based clone is a remote of the local repository. Usually, this remote is called “origin”.\nHaving a web-based remote allows you to push changes to your project online.\nIt enables others to obtain their own clone of your repository (a copy of your repository to their local computer), make changes, and submit a pull request that allows you to integrate their changes.\nFor example, one can create an independent local copy of a project using the following Git command:git clone <insert GitHub link of the repository here>\n\nCollaborators can update their local version of an online repository or pull other’s work into their copy using the command:git pull\n\nSimilarly, they can edit files locally and stage their updates (git add .), commit changes to a new version (git commit) and push changes to the remote online repository using the

I think you shouldn’t have to be a\nLinux-crank or computer scientist to version control data.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-personal-stories#rr-vcs-personal-stories-interiew","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources"},"content":"Further resources to learn more about version control systems, Git, and GitHub.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources","lvl2":"What to Learn Next"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources#rr-vcs-resources-learn","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources","lvl2":"What to Learn Next"},"content":"Look into best practice for writing good-quality code (for example, good naming conventions, informative comments, modular code structure).\nMany such skills are also applicable for using version control well (for example, for writing good commit messages).\nThey also ease using version control by keeping changes neat and localised.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources#rr-vcs-resources-learn","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources","lvl2":"Further Reading"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources#rr-vcs-resources-reading","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources","lvl2":"Further Reading"},"content":"A free and very in-depth book on Git’s myriad of features can be found \n\nhere.\n\nA useful Git cheat sheet can be found \n\nhere.\n\nInteractive tutorials for familiarising yourself with GitHub can be found at \n\nhttps://​skills​.github​.com/.\n\nInteractive tutorials for DataLad can be found at \n\nhandbook​.datalad​.org, and a walk-through of git-annex can be found at \n\ngit​-annex​.branchable​.com​/walkthrough/.\n\nAn article on syncing a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository can be found \n\nhere.\n\nIf you wish to do it all in the browser itself, instructions to do so can be found \n\nhere.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources#rr-vcs-resources-reading","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources","lvl2":"References"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-resources#rr-vcs-resources-references","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Resources","lvl2":"References"},"content":"1.

Some systems call it “a time-point” or “a checkpoint”;\nand this is referred to as “saving your work” in other cases such as in \n\nGoogle docs or \n\nHackMD.\nThe version history may be more or less informative.\n\nAs you keep saving your work by adding changes, you make more and more snapshots.\nYou can think of these as saving versions of these files.\nIf you need to go back to a previous version of a file because of a mistake, or if you changed your mind about a previous update, you can access the file in your preferred version, or return your entire project to a past state.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Version history with a single branch.\n\nIn many version control systems (or in a special document if you do manual version control), you will be able to add a comment for each snapshot.\nClear and concise comments make it easier to get an fast overview of the changes that were made in each versions.\nThis ensures that it is easy to find what you are looking for when you need to go back to a past version.\nYour collaborators will thank you, but so will future versions of yourself.","type":"content","url":"/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-workflow","position":1}]}
