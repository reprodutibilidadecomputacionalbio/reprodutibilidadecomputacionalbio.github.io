CI software is also typically used to identify any conflicts and bugs that are introduced by changes, so they are found and fixed early, minimising the effort required to do so. Running tests regularly also saves humans from needing to do it manually. By making users aware of bugs as early as possible researchers (if the project is a research project) do not waste a lot of time doing work that may need to be thrown away, which may be the case if tests are run infrequently and results are produced using faulty code.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"sQ6dFK2C7G"}],"key":"gip4t2EAHu"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1},"end":{"line":6,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This chapter demands a strong understanding of version control.

Researchers can discover conflicts at the boundaries between new and existing code early, while they are still relatively easy to reconcile. Once the conflict is resolved, work can continue with confidence that the new code honours the requirements of the existing codebase. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments.
