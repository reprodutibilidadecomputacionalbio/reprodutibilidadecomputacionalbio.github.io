At the top of the image is a header that states \"RESEARCHERS\" and at the bottom is a footer stating \"ENVIRONMENT\". The image contains the following. In the top left is a person in a construction crane carrying a series of ones and zeroes wearing a hard-hat looking down. They are labeled \"Research Software Engineer\". In the bottom left, we see an older male-presenting person with a cane scratching his head looking at a math formula sketched onto the side of a building. Next to them is two pink fluffy rams. One is trapped insight of a light bulb. I hope they manage to escape... This scene is labeled \"Research Application Managers\". In the top right is a female-presenting person in a pink shirt sketching ones and zeroes onto the side of a bridge who is labeled \"Data Steward\". In the bottom right is a series of cylinders with little stick figures climbing up ladders to a light bulb that is labeled \"Useful Projects\".
