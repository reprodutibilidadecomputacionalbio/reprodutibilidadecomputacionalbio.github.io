people will join you because they want to know what kind of data on COVID-19 exist, some will come with an intention to be part of a group while learning some skills, some will simply hang out to watch what you are doing, whereas some people will join you because they have relatives who are suffering from COVID-19 infection and they want to speed up the diagnostic process.\nBe prepared to

with team members from different disciplines and backgrounds can provide a wealth of new perspectives.\nHowever, it is important to standardise which concepts all parties should be familiar with for

can be useful to have a shared, editable definitions document.\nAdditionally, it is important to create a supportive environment where anyone can ask for clarification without feeling looked down
