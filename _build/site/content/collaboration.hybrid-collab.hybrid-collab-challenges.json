in a hybrid setting presents a key challenge of establishing a consistent experience and equal level of inclusion for both online and in-person participants.\nThis means overcoming the hurdle of bridging the gap between in-person and virtual interactions.\nAchieving this balance between online and in-person participants is crucial for fostering effective teamwork and maximizing productivity

individuals may not be aware of the support resources available and may struggle to ask questions or access the necessary assistance.\nThis is particularly problematic for individuals with caregiving responsibilities who may need a quieter space to participate in remote conferences, workshops, trainings, and events.\nIn essence, the lack of essential facilities and support needed to participate

convenience, it requires careful planning to ensure that all team members can participate effectively without feeling overwhelmed or excluded.\nAdditionally, relying on asynchronous communication can impact the immediacy of real-time collaboration, slowing down engagement levels, decision-making processes, and resolving issues, as participants needed for feedback or support are not always

and video for both remote and in-person participants.\nEnsuring that meeting materials are accessible to in-person and remote participants can also be challenging, as physical attendees may not have

communication tools that provide accessibility features and enable these
