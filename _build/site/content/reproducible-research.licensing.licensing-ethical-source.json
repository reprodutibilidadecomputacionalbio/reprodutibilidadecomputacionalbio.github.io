fees and/or incur other expenses associated with demonstrating compliance with the terms, depending on decisions made during the legal process.\nThese licenses, because they impose greater restrictions on their licensees, expose a greater attack surface for such bad actors.\nCompliance with the terms of conventional free software licenses is relatively easy to demonstrate.\nTo comply you can simply share the code, if you have a well managed internal code repositories this should be inexpensive.\n(If you have to comb through your git history to remove secrets you inadvisedly committed then things might get more expensive.)\nCompliance with the terms of an ethical source license may however be considerably more complex and expensive to demonstrate definitively.\nSuch cost are less likely to be weaponised against individual end users of software licensed in this fashion but rather institutions which depend on software on this kind.\nInstitutions which are either small enough have their finances seriously damaged or their operation impeded, or which are large enough to extract a monetary settlement of some kind, would be possible targets.\nIn short they suffer from

if it is not the intent of proponents of ethical source some parties may seek to use technical enforcement measures, also known as digital rights/restrictions management (DRM), to enforce the terms of ethical source licenses.\nReturning to the earlier example, if sequencing instruments being used for unlicensed purposes could be remotely disabled by their manufactures this raises some questions.\nWhat about the use of these machines with 3rd party or unlicensed components in places which cannot afford ‘official’ components but which need to use these machines for public health reasons?\nProperty rights, the ‘doctrine of first sale’, and ‘right(s) to repair’ would conventionally protect the ostensible owners of equipment from such an imposition by its original manufacturer.\nThese rights come at the expense of being able to use technical enforcement measures to police the misuse of these systems but with the benefit of protecting the freedoms to do as you will with your own property.\nTechnical enforcement measures are often brittle, what happens when your sequencer can’t phone home to check-in with the server that tells it if its license is valid, or when that server disappears because the model is no longer in its official support window?\nTechnical enforcement measures are often invasive, to avoid being circumvented they must run with the highest level of privilege on a system and this access can readily be abused to surveil users as well as creating a security weakness.\nTechnical enforcement measures are often ineffective, they can often be bypassed by technically competent users who can share their bypasses with other less technical users.\nThese measures are often more effective legally than they are technically due to the

manufactures to abuse these statues to prevent users of their products from using them in ways not in the financial interest of the original manufacturer such as by using cheaper 3rd party consumables or repairs.\nManufacturers can also leverage their ongoing access to their devices to non-consensually, (generally with the veneer of consent provided by requiring the acceptance of an end user license agreement (EULA)), spy on end users harvesting their data and extracting value from it.\nExpanded usage restrictions could create an incentive or excuse for manufactures to strengthen or
