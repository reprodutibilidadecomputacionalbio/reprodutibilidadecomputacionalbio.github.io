comparison to more traditional publications, which usually aim to share some new result, a software paper (sometimes known as a software metapaper) aims to share a new piece of software with the research community.\nIn this sense, software papers are close to method papers traditionally published in experimental sciences.\nSoftware papers tend to be shorter than traditional articles, typically ranging between 2 and 10 pages, and focus on describing the software, its use and its relationship to other pieces of software in the community.\nThis helps fill the niche between methods sections in traditional publications and papers on algorithms or techniques.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"RD4fVUPePN"}],"key":"GKfhwwaevQ"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":13,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Why

papers are much shorter than traditional publications, allowing more time to be spent on the software while still providing an avenue for publication.\nBy specifically publishing in a software-focused journal, you are exposing your software to an audience which is already engaged with research software.\nYou are also adding your software to a curated index of high-quality, peer-reviewed code, increasing the likelihood that your code will be found and used by another researcher.\nThrough the peer-review process, not only is the paper itself evaluated, but the associated code can sometimes be reviewed.\nJust as in traditional publishing, this process is intended to provide constructive feedback, helping to improve the quality of the software and surrounding systems.","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"azPEq6t7UD"}],"key":"dWj6XXUIwQ"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In
