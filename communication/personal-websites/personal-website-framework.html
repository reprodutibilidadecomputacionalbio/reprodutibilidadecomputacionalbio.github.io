tools, and
libraries that help developers build and maintain websites more efficiently.
Frameworks provide a structured foundation, offering reusable code modules,
common design patterns, and guidelines, which help streamline the development
process and promote best practices. They essentially “frame” the development by
managing basic functionalities and allowing developers to focus on the unique
aspects of their projects rather than repetitive tasks.</p><h2 id="cm-website-frameworks-benefits" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Benefits of using a framework</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#cm-website-frameworks-benefits" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Frameworks provide several benefits in website development:</p><ul><li><strong>Code Reusability</strong>: Common functions are built-in, which
reduces redundancy.</li><li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: They allow faster development by eliminating the need
to code every component from scratch.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Frameworks provide a solid structure that can grow with the
website.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Many frameworks come with built-in security features and
updates, which help mitigate vulnerabilities.</li></ul><h2 id="cm-website-frameworks-list" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Popular frameworks</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#cm-website-frameworks-list" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>Here, we list some commonly used frameworks.

website development, a framework is a set of pre-written code, tools, and\nlibraries that help developers build and maintain websites more efficiently.\nFrameworks provide a structured foundation, offering reusable code modules,\ncommon design patterns, and guidelines, which help streamline the development\nprocess and promote best practices. They essentially “frame” the development by\nmanaging basic functionalities and allowing developers to focus on the unique\naspects of their projects rather than repetitive tasks.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"DrNRX2uQ72"}],"key":"gSynfuIuEu"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Benefits of using a framework","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"key":"MUhlwKcOPG"}],"label":"cm-website-frameworks-benefits","identifier":"cm-website-frameworks-benefits","html_id":"cm-website-frameworks-benefits","key":"c8JSZXuazb"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Frameworks provide several benefits in website development:","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"Cu1HQ6D6d0"}],"key":"nMZBjq84w3"},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"spread":false,"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":28,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Code Reusability","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"Ryori0HRQ8"}],"key":"ZiOOAIRjKs"},{"type":"text","value":": Common functions are built-in, which\nreduces redundancy.","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"fGvNRrqLOp"}],"key":"eQSojVjZTc"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Efficiency","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"key":"MKA5E3QDhD"}],"key":"ztFkqzLjoV"},{"type":"text","value":": They allow faster development by eliminating the need\nto code every component from scratch.","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"key":"b39A6dn1mc"}],"key":"qpMXRfE7x1"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Scalability","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"key":"QtUMiyp92N"}],"key":"TlUwvUMwRN"},{"type":"text","value":": Frameworks provide a solid structure that can grow with the\nwebsite.","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"key":"vtusdEkZna"}],"key":"WK5VsyzNui"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":28,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Security","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":1}},"key":"xgDssPNMhe"}],"key":"wBBf5682wR"},{"type":"text","value":": Many frameworks come with built-in security features and\nupdates, which help mitigate vulnerabilities.","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1},"end":{"line":26,"column":1}},"key":"unzqpojQrs"}],"key":"X3GLjy5qBX"}],"key":"bkC34dtChI"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":30,"column":1},"end":{"line":30,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Popular frameworks","position":{"start":{"line":30,"column":1},"end":{"line":30,"column":1}},"key":"TnuEwdMZuV"}],"label":"cm-website-frameworks-list","identifier":"cm-website-frameworks-list","html_id":"cm-website-frameworks-list","key":"DemXvppmke"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":32,"column":1},"end":{"line":34,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Here, we list some commonly used frameworks.
