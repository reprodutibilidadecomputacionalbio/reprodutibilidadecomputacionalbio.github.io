testing is a style of testing that focuses on retesting after changes are made.\nThe results of tests after the changes are compared to the results before, and errors are raised if these are different.\nRegression testing is intended to ensure that changes (enhancements or defect fixes) to the software have not adversely affected it.\nThe likelihood of any code change impacting functionalities that are not directly associated with the code is always there and it is essential that regression testing is conducted to make sure that fixing one thing has not broken another.\nRegression testing can be performed during any level of testing (unit, integration, system, or acceptance) but it is mostly relevant during system testing.\nAny test can be reused, and so any test can become a regression test.","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"OUP54Jt6ar"}],"key":"q5ucv81orN"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Regression
