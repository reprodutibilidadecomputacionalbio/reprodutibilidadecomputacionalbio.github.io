tests are responsible for testing individual elements of code in an isolated and highly targeted way.\nThe functionality of individual functions and classes are tested on their own.\nThe purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.\nA unit is the smallest testable part of any software.\nIn procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function or procedure.\nIn object-oriented programming the smallest unit is typically a method.\nIt usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output.\nAny external dependencies should be replaced with stub or mock implementations to focus the test completely on the code in question.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"aEZ2pAZXgn"}],"key":"K5nhMAgFxN"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Unit

example system tests are often time consuming to run and it will likely be impractical to have system tests for every possible path through a code that has more than a few conditional statements.\nUnit tests are smaller, faster, and so it is more practical to cover all possible cases with

unit testing leads to more reliable code, but there are other benefits too.\nFirstly, it makes development faster by making bugs easier to find.\nLarger-scale tests which test large chunks of code

developers find the cause of a bug much more quickly than higher-level tests or code with no tests at all.\nUnit tests also make fixing bugs faster and easier because they catch bugs early while the impact is limited to small individual units.\nIf bugs are not detected early via unit tests then it may be a long time before they are discovered, impacting later work that built on the faulty
